				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor002"></a>Overview of the Administrative Review Process<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker000"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker001"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker002"></a>Regulatory enforcement of EMTALA involves three agencies: the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) (with the support of state licensing surveyors), the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) and the Office of Inspector General (OIG). In addition, the <a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a>Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may follow up on a violation of EMTALA with a request for documents and information from Hill-Burton hospitals that have community service obligations.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The enforcement of EMTALA is a <a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a>complaint-driven process. Upon a confirmed EMTALA violation, CMS may suspend or <a id="_idIndexMarker005"></a>terminate a hospital’s provider agreement. The notice of suspension or termination can be 23 days (if the violations constitute immediate jeopardy) or 90 days (if the violations do not constitute immediate jeopardy).</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">All confirmed EMTALA violations must be forwarded to the OIG to determine whether civil money penalties should be imposed for the violations. In considering sanctions, OIG must request that the QIO assess the appropriateness of the medical screening examination, the presence of an emergency medical condition, patient stabilization and other clinical issues related to a possible EMTALA violation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The QIO assessment, referred to as the 60-day review, is an important part of the enforcement process and a potential opportunity to reduce or eliminate possible civil money sanctions if the assessment is favorable to the hospital. Hospitals should be aware that, in at least one instance, an OIG enforcement attorney has advised that failure to respond to or participate in a QIO 60-day review may increase the likelihood or amount of civil money penalties.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Under the EMTALA statute (Appendix A), the OIG has the authority to impose civil money penalties up to $50,000 against hospitals and physicians ($25,000 for hospitals with less than 100 beds), an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r to exclude a hospital or physician from the Medicare and Medicaid programs for violations of EMTALA that are “gross and flagrant or repeated.” In December, 2016, the OIG issued final regulations updating the amount of civil money penalties, including EMTALA fines. Effective in 2017, the OIG may now impose civil penalties up to $104,826 against hospitals and physicians ($52,414 for hospitals with less than 100 beds) for an EMTALA violation. The maximum amounts of the fines are subject to annual adjustment for inflation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker006"></a>Physicians may be <a id="_idIndexMarker007"></a>penalized for:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">Signing a certification for transfer if a physician knew or should have known that the benefits of the transfer did not outweigh the risks, or misrepresenting a patient’s condition or other information; or<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2"> </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">Failing or refusing to respond within a reasonable period of time (while serving as an on-call physician) after being requested to come to the hospital to examine, treat, or transfer a patient. This applies to on-call physicians at the hospital where the individual presents initially, as well as on-call physicians at a hospital with specialized capabilities or facilities which may receive a transferred patient; or</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">Refusing to accept an appropriate transfer, including on-call physicians.</li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In the 2016 regulations increasing civil money penalties for an EMTALA violation, the definition of a “responsible physician” was expanded to apply to on-call physicians. Fines may now be imposed on on-call physicians who fail or refuse to respond to a hospital that receives a request to accept an appropriate transfer.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In the same regulations, the OIG added as a mitigating factor situations in which a hospital takes appropriate and timely corrective action in response to a violation. However, the corrective actions must be completed prior to CMS initiating an investigation of the hospital and must include disclosing the violation to CMS prior to CMS receiving a complaint regarding the violation from another source. Early corrective action and reporting to CMS does not eliminate potential liability for fines, but it may reduce the amount of fines if the OIG decides to impose penalties for the violation.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In addition, the OIG may seek to exclude a physician or a hospital from the Medicare program for a violation of EMTALA. Physicians are subject to exclusion from the Medicare program for gross and flagrant, or repeated, violations. Hospitals are subject to termination of their Medicare provider agreement if they fail substantially to meet EMTALA requirements.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In 2003, CMS adopted a regulation that sanctions under EMTALA for inappropriate transfers during a national emergency (such as a bioterrorist attack) do not apply to a hospital with a dedicated emergency department located in an emergency area if certain conditions are present <span class="Italic">(see chapter 16, “Application of EMTALA to Disasters and Public Health Emergencies”)</span>.</p>

				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor003"></a>Questions<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="All-Caps-Bold">Note:</span> CHA has published the <span class="Italic">California Hospital Survey Manual</span> that describes the scope of, and response to, CMS and California Department of Public Health (CDPH) surveys, and includes guidance for responding to CMS investigations of EMTALA compliance. The discussion in this chapter only addresses the scope and response to EMTALA surveys, as well as reviews of EMTALA compliance by the QIOs and the OIG. Hospitals should review the <span class="Italic">California Hospital Survey Manual</span> for additional information on responding to surveys and preparing plans of correction.</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"></a>What is the difference between EMTALA enforcement and other Medicare certification reviews?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">The obligation to comply with EMTALA is a term of a hospital’s Medicare provider agreement. The obligations are therefore in addition to compliance with the Conditions of Participation in the Medicare program.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">All of the EMTALA obligations are considered equal (medical screening examinations, stabilizing treatment and appropriate transfers, signage, central log, on-call roster and patient transfer records, on-call response, and reporting EMTALA violations); the failure to meet any EMTALA obligation constitutes a breach of the Medicare provider agreement, for which CMS may terminate the agreement. The notice of termination does not require a hearing prior to the termination action; instead, CMS may give a hospital notice of termination of its Medicare provider status on 23- or 90-day notice based on a survey report confirming a violation of EMTALA.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>How is an EMTALA investigation started?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">The enforcement of EMTALA is a complaint-driven process. An EMTALA investigation is usually started when a complaint is filed with CMS or the state survey agency (in California, this is CDPH’s Licensing and Certification Division). The sources of complaints include patients and families, hospitals, physicians and other health care professionals, and ambulance and emergency services agencies. An EMTALA investigation may also originate from a licensing, certification or Joint Commission survey that identifies possible EMTALA violations during the course of the survey.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">Regardless of the source of an EMTALA <a id="_idIndexMarker008"></a>complaint, CMS must first determine whether the complaint identifies a possible EMTALA violation and warrants an investigation. If it does, CMS will direct the state survey agency to conduct a complaint survey (CMS can also conduct the survey). The results of the survey are forwarded to CMS, which then makes the final decision as to whether an EMTALA violation has occurred. If CMS determines that an EMTALA violation has occurred, CMS may then give notice of termination of a hospital’s Medicare provider agreement.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a>What is the frequency of EMTALA investigations?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">There is limited research or reporting of the frequency of EMTALA investigations. In a February 2017 article in the Annals of Emergency Medicine, a research team consisting of physicians and other health care professionals published findings on the incidence of CMS enforcement of EMTALA between 2005 and 2014. The team reported that there were 4,772 investigations, of which 2,118 (44%) resulted in citations of EMTALA deficiencies at 1,498 hospitals. The team also reported a declining trend in enforcement.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">The team also looked at the allegations by tag number in the EMTALA <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>. Most of the citations issued by CMS involve failure to follow hospital policies and procedures (73%). As to substantive requirement, failure to conduct an appropriate medical screening examinations was cited in 55% of the cases; other common citations were failure to provide stabilizing treatment (25%), transfers (28%), on-call performance (14%), and accepting hospital obligations (16%). As to administrative requirements, citations for the central log were cited in 25% of the cases.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-4"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>&#9;Reference:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-6">Terp et al., “Enforcement of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, 2005 to 2014,” 69 Annals of Emergency Medicine, No. 2, February 2017 (pp. 155-162).</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>Does EMTALA provide for <a id="_idIndexMarker009"></a>whistleblower protection?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">EMTALA and California whistleblower protection laws are discussed in chapter 12, “Reporting Patient-Dumping Violations,” under <a href="">G.&#160;“Can a hospital retaliate against a physician or staff member who reports an EMTALA or state anti-dumping law violation?,” page&#160;12.3</a>.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>What is the scope of an EMTALA complaint survey?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idIndexMarker010"></a>A complaint survey must be conducted within five working days after receiving CMS authorization. All surveys are unannounced. The focus of the survey is on the initial allegation of a violation and the discovery of additional violations. The purposes of the survey are to:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-7">Ascertain whether a violation occurred, and if so, whether it constituted an immediate and serious threat to patient health and safety;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-7">Identify any patterns of violations at the hospital; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-7">Assess whether the hospital has policies and procedures to address the EMTALA obligations.</li></ol></li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If the survey confirms that a violation occurred, the surveyors are directed to continue their investigation, with an emphasis on EMTALA compliance within the six-month period preceding the survey. If the survey confirms that a violation did not occur, the surveyors are directed to seek assurance that the hospital’s policies and procedures, physician certifications for transfer, and other actions are in compliance with the EMTALA obligations. The survey consists of the following tasks.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Entrance Conference</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">A brief entrance conference is conducted with the hospital chief executive officer (or his or her designee) and any other invited hospital staff to explain the nature of the allegation, the purpose of the investigation and the standards for the survey. The identities of the complainant and the patient are not to be disclosed in the absence of written consent.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a>Document Request</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The hospital is requested to provide the documents and information set forth in Appendix J, “Hospital Records Subject to EMTALA Enforcement Survey.” These include central logs, policies and procedures, medical staff records, on-call rosters, personnel files, in-service records, quality improvement minutes, etc.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a>Patient Record Request</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Although a single occurrence may trigger an EMTALA survey, a sample of patient medical records must be reviewed in order to identify the presence of additional violations or a pattern of violations. Therefore, the surveyors are directed to select 20 to 50 patient records to review in detail; the sample size may be expanded as necessary to adequately investigate possible violations or patterns of violations.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The type of records reviewed will vary based on the nature of the complaint and the types of patients seeking emergency services. For example, an inappropriate transfer complaint will require the review of patients who were transferred by the hospital. If the review identifies multiple violations, the surveyors are directed to determine, if possible, whether the pattern of violations is related to diagnosis, race, color, insurance status, nationality or disability.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"></a>Further Review</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If one or more violations are identified from a review of the medical records, the surveyors are directed to obtain copies of the records for the cases of suspected violations. In addition, the surveyors will review documents pertaining to quality assuranc<span class="No-break">e/p</span>erformance improvement for the dedicated emergency department(s) and remedial actions taken in response to the violations. Corrective action taken before the survey will be documented by the surveyor and considered in the recommendations submitted to the CMS regional office. Additional information on the record review and documentation is discussed in chapter 3, “Medical Screening Examinations,” and pages 9-11 of Appendix K, “Investigative Procedures for EMTALA Surveyors” (part of the <span class="Italic">State Operations Manual</span>).</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"></a>Expanded Scope of Survey</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If, during the survey of an accredited hospital, the surveyors identify a possible violation of the Medicare Conditions of Participation, the surveyors will seek authorization from the CMS regional office to expand the investigation. If the hospital is not accredited, the surveyors may expand the survey without prior contact with the CMS regional office.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"></a>Interviews</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">A key part of the survey is the interview of hospital staff and physicians. The guidance for surveyors states that the surveyor “may be able to gather a great deal of information from the admitting clerk in the emergency department, the nurses on shift at the time the individual sought treatment, and the Director of Quality Improvement in the hospital to name a few.” The surveyors may also interview witnesses, ambulance personnel, the patient or his or her family members, or the personnel at a hospital that accepted or received the patient.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"></a>Exit Survey</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">At the end of the survey, the survey team will schedule an exit conference to review the scope of the investigation, the survey tasks, the requirements investigated and whether any Conditions of Participation were violated. The surveyors are directed not to advise the hospital whether a violation was confirmed because that determination is reserved for the CMS regional office. However, the surveyors are directed to inform the hospital staff of the consequences of a violation and the time frames to correct any violation that may be confirmed by the regional office.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The results of the survey are documented on the Statement of Deficiencies and Plan of Correction (Form CMS 2567), the same form used for validation surveys. The paperwork must be forwarded to the CMS regional office within prescribed time frames. A discussion of how the survey report should be prepared is discussed on pages 13-16 of Appendix K.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In addition to the survey team report, the CMS regional office is directed to request a <a id="_idIndexMarker011"></a>QIO review before terminating a hospital’s provider agreement for violations. The purpose of the QIO review is to determine:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">If a medical screening was appropriate (i.e., suitable for the presenting symptoms and conducted in a non-disparate fashion);</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">If an individual had an emergency medical condition;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">In the case of a pregnant woman, whether there was inadequate time to effect a safe transfer prior to the delivery, or the transfer posed a threat to the health and safety of the woman or the unborn child;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">If stabilizing treatment was appropriate within the capability of the hospital;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">If a transfer was made with qualified personnel and transportation equipment;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">If applicable, the on-call physician’s response time was reasonable; and</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">If a transfer was appropriate for the individual, including a determination that the medical benefits of the transfer outweighed the risks or the patient made an informed request for the transfer.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The QIO must be provided five days to conduct the review (this is often referred to as “The Five-Day Review”). The review by the QIO is not required if the delay would jeopardize the health and safety of patients.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">There is no time frame for the CMS regional office to accept, modify or reject the draft survey report. The “Investigative Procedures for EMTALA Surveyors” (part of the <span class="Italic">State Operations Manual</span>) strongly encourages the regional office to share information with the hospital (subject to applicable privacy laws).</p>

			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"></a>23-Day Termination</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">CMS may terminate the hospital’s provider agreement on a 23-day notice if it determines that the violation constitutes imminent jeopardy to patient health and safety. The following examples are provided as guidance to the CMS regional offices as to the types of cases for which a 23-day termination notice may be indicated:</p>

				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"></a>How should a hospital respond to a notice of termination?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">If CMS determines that a hospital has violated EMTALA, the hospital will receive a transmittal letter and a Statement of Deficiencies (Form CMS 2567) from the CMS regional office.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"></a>The Transmittal Letter</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">The transmittal letter advises the hospital whether CMS intends to seek termination of the hospital’s Medicare provider agreement on a 23- or 90-day notice. The notice also states when the plan of correction must be submitted to CMS and the date on which CMS will publish the notice of termination in the local newspaper if an acceptable plan of correction has not been submitted to CMS in a timely manner.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"></a>The <a id="_idIndexMarker014"></a>Statement of Deficiencies</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">The Statement of Deficiencies will cite the EMTALA tag numbers (e.g., A-240<span class="No-break">9/C</span>-2409 for an inappropriate transfer) identified in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> for each EMTALA regulation for which the hospital is not in compliance. The Statement of Deficiencies will include the text of the cited regulation, the general nature of the noncompliance (such as “the hospital failed to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination”) and recite the facts for each violation, including specific patient medical records, hospital practices or information obtained from staff interviews as evidence of alleged violations of EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"></a>EMTALA Compliance Team</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">Upon receipt of the transmittal letter containing the notice of termination and the Statement of Deficiencies, the hospital should immediately assemble an EMTALA compliance team and establish a timetable for preparing the plan of correction. The compliance team should include, at a minimum, one or more members of the executive staff, department heads, medical directors, the compliance officer, risk management and the quality improvement director. As appropriate, the hospital should add other staff members and legal counsel to provide the necessary expertise for developing and implementing an effective plan of correction. The EMTALA compliance team should be responsible for developing, implementing and overseeing the plan of correction, reviewing EMTALA compliance in other hospital departments and evaluating cases cited in the Statement of Deficiencies for possible civil money penalties or potential litigation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker015"></a>Plan of Correction</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">A hospital must submit a credible and effective plan of correction in order for CMS to withdraw the termination action. The hospital team should review the Statement of Deficiencies, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, applicable department and quality management policies, existing hospital practices and in-service education programs. Hospital staff should be interviewed if there are gaps in the patient medical record or other facts that are pertinent to the alleged violation. The hospital should consider describing in a transmittal letter to CMS or the plan of correction the process followed to bring the hospital into compliance with EMTALA (especially if responding to a 23-day notice of termination).</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">The plan of correction should include the following three elements.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-4 _idGenParaOverride-4">Corrective Action</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">For each deficiency cited by CMS, the plan should identify the corrective action implemented to remedy the deficiency. The action may require the development of new policies and procedures, the revision of existing policies and procedures or other changes in hospital practices that are necessary to bring the hospital into compliance.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">For each corrective action taken by the hospital, the plan of correction must state the specific actions to correct the deficiency, the timetable for implementing the action, the performance measures to ensure compliance and the staff person responsible for overseeing compliance. To the extent feasible, the corrective action should be implemented prior to the submission of the plan of correction.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-4 _idGenParaOverride-4">In-Service Education</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">As discussed in chapter 15, “Quality Improvement and Risk Management,” in-service education is the key to effective EMTALA compliance. It is essential that all affected hospital staff are aware of the changes in policies and practices adopted by the hospital in response to the statement of deficiencies. During the re-survey of the hospital to verify compliance with the plan of correction, the surveyors are likely to question staff as to their understanding of the new policies and practices. The hospital should maintain documentation of the in-service education programs, including copies of the sign-in sheets and the education materials distributed to staff as part of the in-service education plan.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-4 _idGenParaOverride-4">Quality Improvement</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">The hospital must adopt effective quality management practices and survey tools in order to ensure that the hospital complies with the plan of correction and that the deficiencies will not be repeated. Recommendations for monitoring EMTALA compliance are provided in chapter 15, “Quality Improvement and Risk Management.” The quality improvement program adopted in response to the statement of deficiencies should be described in the plan of correction. The program should be implemented concurrent with the submission of the plan of correction, and the results should be available for review during the re-survey.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"></a>Review of Hospital Compliance with EMTALA</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">In addition to preparing the plan of correction, the team should review EMTALA compliance in areas that were not the focus of the original survey (for example, patient transfers, if the survey focus was on medical screening) or in other locations of the hospital that were not visited by the surveyors at the time of the original survey.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">Because the scope of the re-survey is not limited to the issues cited in the Statement of Deficiencies, the surveyors may visit other departments providing emergency services. For example, if the original survey was limited to the emergency department, the surveyors may visit labor and delivery or other departments during the re-survey to verify compliance with EMTALA. The team should review policies and practices in other departments, implement changes in the policies and practices as necessary, initiate in-service education and implement quality improvement activities.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"></a>Review of Cases</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">The team should also oversee the review of the medical records copied by the surveyors (a list will usually be provided to the hospital) to determine potential liability for civil money penalties or litigation. In accordance with the “Investigative Procedures for EMTALA Surveyors” (part of the <span class="Italic">State Operations Manual</span>), some or all of the medical records will be forwarded by CMS to the QIO for analysis of potential EMTALA violations and quality of care issues. As discussed later in this chapter, the preliminary QIO findings are forwarded to the hospital for review and comment. The final QIO report is forwarded by CMS to the OIG for consideration of the imposition of civil money penalties.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">The review of the medical records should be performed to determine whether the description of each case in the Statement of Deficiencies is accurate and whether the entire medical record was copied for the surveyors. In some cases, the surveyors receive only a portion of a record, which may result in only a partial understanding of the case. If a medical record reflects poor documentation, the team should attempt to fill in the gaps with supplementary documentation. If the medical record itself requires revision, this should be done in an appropriate manner in accordance with hospital policy. If the team identifies medical records that may pose liability for civil money penalties or potential litigation, the cases should be reported to risk management. The hospital, under the direction of legal counsel, should continue to compile any information and documentation that is available to defend the hospital’s actions in the event that it later becomes necessary.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"></a>Does submitting a plan of correction imply that a hospital admits it violated EMTALA?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">No. The submission of a plan of correction by a hospital to address allegations of noncompliance with EMTALA is not interpreted as an admission by the hospital of an EMTALA violation. Many hospitals include a sentence at the beginning of the plan of correction that the submission of the plan of correction does not constitute an admission or agreement of the facts or conclusions contained in the Statement of Deficiencies.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"></a>What can the hospital do if it disagrees with the survey findings?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">In some cases, the hospital may disagree that its actions constitute a violation of EMTALA, or believe that the survey team misinterpreted the EMTALA obligations or accepted industry guidelines and practices. Although submitting a plan of correction is not admission of a violation, the hospital may feel that it should not have been cited at all.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">The “Investigative Procedures for EMTALA Surveyors” (Appendix K) provide that the “hospital has the opportunity to present evidence to CMS that it believes demonstrates its compliance and the opportunity to comment on evidence CMS believes demonstrates the hospital’s noncompliance.” For example, the hospital may be able to present its case to CMS between the exit conference and the issuance of a Statement of Deficiencies. In a very rare case, the hospital may be able to convince CMS to withdraw a Statement of Deficiencies after it is issued.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">However, CMS may reject a plan of correction that attacks the findings in the Statement of Deficiencies, without a stated plan for correcting the alleged deficiencies cited in the survey. Even if the plan of correction includes compliance actions, CMS may still request that the hospital rewrite the plan of correction to delete the parts of the plan that attack the findings.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">If a hospital desires to dispute the findings of the survey, it needs to move quickly to compile its evidence of compliance and then present its case to CMS. The hospital should consult with physicians, legal counsel and others who may assist in confirming whether its actions were appropriate or inappropriate under EMTALA. A request should be made to CMS for copies of the five-day reviews conducted by the QIO to evaluate the analysis presented to CMS.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">Despite convictions that the hospital met its obligations, the hospital should expect that it will have an uphill battle to reverse one or more alleged deficiencies in the absence of obvious mistakes by the survey team.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"></a>What is the role of the <a id="_idIndexMarker016"></a>QIO in the EMTALA enforcement process?</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Following the completion of the EMTALA survey process, including one or more re-surveys, CMS will usually refer one or more cases from the EMTALA surveys to the QIO for review. The QIO review, typically referred to as the “60-day review,” is an opportunity for the hospital and physicians to discuss the cases selected by CMS for QIO review. The QIO is required to review the facts of each case, as well as comment on quality concerns. However, the QIO does not determine whether a hospital or physician violated the EMTALA obligations; that determination is the responsibility of CMS and the OIG.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The QIO 60-day review is performed as part of the EMTALA sanctions process. In considering sanctions, the OIG must request that the QIO assess whether a patient had an emergency medical condition (EMC) that was not stabilized, in addition to other medical issues. Except where delay would jeopardize health or safety or there is no medical issue to review, OIG must request a QIO review before terminating or suspending a provider, or imposing civil money penalties.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> One QIO organization has commented that a number of hospitals have not responded to the QIO review. Hospitals should consider the QIO review an essential part of the OIG process. From the viewpoint of the OIG, ignoring the QIO notice indicates a failure to take seriously the review process and the EMTALA obligations. Therefore, the failure to respond to the QIO review may result in higher than anticipated demands from the OIG for civil penalties or settlement amounts.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The QIO process described below follows chapter 9 of the <span class="Italic">Quality Improvement Organization Manual</span>, which was revised by CMS in 2016.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"></a>Notice</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The QIO begins the process by providing written notice of the 60-day review to the responsible physician and hospital. The notice includes:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The names of the patient or patients;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The date(s) of the alleged violation;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">An invitation to meet by telephone or in person and to submit additional information within 30 days; and</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">A copy of the regulations.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The notice of the 60-day review that is typically mailed by the QIO does not include copies of the completed five-day reviews that were performed by the QIO prior to the issuance by CMS of the Statement of Deficiencies. If the hospital has not requested the five-day reviews before receiving the QIO notice, it should immediately contact CMS for copies of the reviews.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The QIO physician reviewer uses an EMTALA Physician Review Worksheet <span class="Italic">(see Appendix W)</span> to evaluate each case that is referred to the QIO (the worksheet for the 60-day review is the same form that is used for the five-day review). This worksheet includes each element of the EMTALA obligations. The worksheet is in the form of questions, with a checkbox (usually with “yes,” “no” and “not applicable”) for each element and space for comments by the reviewing physician. Items 14 and 15 address whether there were inappropriate delays in the medical screening or stabilizing treatment and whether there were any quality of care issues. At the end of the worksheet (Item 16), the physician reviewer will summarize the overall findings. The worksheet includes an admonition that the reviewer should not state whether the actions of the hospital or the physician violated EMTALA.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The QIO evaluation is usually written by a physician in the same specialty as the responsible physician (for example, an emergency physician will review alleged violations of EMTALA for failure to provide an adequate medical screening in the emergency department). In some cases, the QIO may assign the case to a physician in a different specialty, such as a psychiatrist to review a psychiatric assessment performed by an emergency physician. If this occurs, the hospital or responsible physician should request the QIO to assign a physician in the same specialty as the treating physician.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"></a>Reply to the Notice</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The hospital or physician must reply to the QIO notice for the 60-day review in a timely manner in order to schedule a meeting or submit a written response for each case evaluated by the reviewing physician. The meeting or written response usually must be completed within 30 days from receipt of the QIO notice.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In preparing for a meeting or drafting the response, the hospital should consider that the QIO review is part of the OIG process. The hospital should include both clinical analysis and any applicable legal arguments that respond to the reviewer’s concerns and findings. As appropriate, the response should address each of the EMTALA elements considered by the reviewer to be applicable to the patient’s case.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The hospital or physician should also consider the limited information that may have been given to the QIO. In most cases, the QIO reviewer has received a copy of the patient medical records for the cases, and some information or notes compiled by the surveyors; the QIO does not in all cases have a copy of the survey report (i.e., Statement of Deficiencies) or the plan of correction.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The 60-day review affords the hospital or physician an opportunity to submit additional information and documents (including, as appropriate, declarations from physicians and nurses, tapes or films, or other information that may have not been available or requested at the time of the on-site survey) that provide a more complete picture to the reviewer of the cases.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> If the cases reviewed by the QIO involve emergency department saturation or capacity constraints, the hospital should submit documentation of the emergency department census (hour-by-hour if available), acuity of patients held in the emergency department (especially trauma cases and patients waiting for an inpatient bed), waiting times and other information that provide greater context to circumstances existing at the time of the incidents that were cited by CMS in the Statement of Deficiencies.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"></a>The QIO Meeting</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The QIO must provide written notice to an affected hospital or physician of the opportunity to schedule a telephonic or face-to-face meeting. The QIO is directed to inform the OIG through the appropriate CMS Regional Office of the time and date of the meeting, and whether the hospital or physician declines the opportunity to meet with the QIO. The meeting is an informal forum for discussion of the EMTALA case(s); it is not an adversarial hearing governed by rules of evidence, cross-examination of witnesses or other legal rules.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The primary purpose of the meeting is for the physician an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r hospital to present their views on the case. Past experience with QIO meetings indicates that the QIO personnel prefer that one or more physicians present the hospital’s view of the case(s). While the hospital and physicians may have legal counsel present, it is optional for the QIO to have legal counsel at the meeting. The QIO may limit the scope, extent and manner of any questioning by legal counsel. The physician or hospital may present expert testimony in written or oral form, although the QIO may reasonably limit the number of witnesses and the length of irrelevant or repetitive testimony. The presenting hospital or physician should not expect the QIO or a physician reviewer to provide a clinical opinion about the case during the meeting.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The QIO must arrange for a recording of the meeting, but it is not required to produce a transcript of the recording unless requested by the CMS Regional Office or the OIG.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">After the completion of the meeting, the QIO is not required to consider additional information from the hospital or physician that was not submitted at the meeting, unless the QIO requests the information before the end of the meeting. Under CMS Guidelines, the time frame to submit any additional information after the meeting is five days.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Hospitals should not consider the 60-day review as an unnecessary burden. It may be an opportunity to limit the likelihood or amount of civil money penalties. Some pointers for preparing for the meeting include the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">Ensure that the QIO notice is immediately referred to the hospital representative designated as the point person for managing the EMTALA review process. The notice should also be forwarded to legal counsel as appropriate. The QIO notice is typically sent to the hospital chief executive officer. If the importance or timeliness of the QIO notice is not immediately apparent, it may result in either scrambling to arrange and prepare for the meeting or to submit a written response within the 30- day period from the receipt of the QIO notice.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">After reviewing the QIO notice and identifying the cases selected for review, the hospital should identify the key persons who should participate in the meeting and their availability. While participation of legal counsel is not required for the meeting, hospitals should consult their in-house or outside legal counsel with respect to the QIO notice and the meeting since the 60-day review may be preparatory to a decision by CMS to refer one or more cases to the OIG for consideration of civil money penalties.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">As soon as possible, the hospital should contact the QIO representative identified in the QIO notice to arrange a date for the meeting.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">As noted above, the hospital should contact CMS to obtain the five-day reviews of the cases selected for the meeting in order to determine the issues identified by the QIO in its prior review of the cases.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The hospital’s team should review the facts of the cases, including any internal reviews of the cases, or interviews with physicians or hospital staff regarding the facts or circumstances of the cases. If the medical record is incomplete, an effort should be made to identify the missing information that may be pertinent to the presentation of the case at the QIO meeting.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The hospital’s team should identify any additional information that the reviewer may not have received in conducting the five-day review (for example, missing parts of the medical record).</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">At the time the hospital is scheduling the meeting for the 60-day review, a representative of the hospital should request a QIO representative to identify the documents relating to each case, including the contents of the patient medical record. Even if the QIO cannot release copies of the documents, it may be possible to determine whether the records are complete.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If the timing of the medical screening exam or other emergency services is an issue, the hospital should review the emergency department census and other relevant information for the date of service.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The hospital should also review whether there are documents or information that the surveyors may not have reviewed or taken in connection with the survey. For example, in a case involving a patient who died in the emergency waiting room while waiting to be seen, a hospital submitted to the QIO a videotape of the waiting room that included the patient up to the point of death.</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">After compiling all available information, the hospital’s team should consider its approach to each case, including discussion of unusual facts or circumstances related to the case, the clinical analysis of the care and treatment provided to each patient, and any legal arguments.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The hospital should identify a member of the management team to introduce the physicians and staff who will participate in the meeting. It may be helpful for the member of the management team to make a brief (5-10 minute) presentation at the meeting to provide an overview of the hospital and its services, the characteristics of its service area, the demographics of the patient population (especially emergency patients), emergency department volume and other relevant data, and any other information that may be helpful to provide a picture of the hospital and its role in the community.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Each case selected for QIO review should be presented by a physician, such as the chief medical officer, director of quality, director of the emergency department, etc. While not required, it is usually helpful to script each case presentation in relevant time sequence, beginning with the patient’s arrival and continuing to the patient’s departure or other disposition. The case presentation should be complete to make sure that all relevant facts and circumstances of the cases are presented “on the record.” As may be applicable, this includes pre-arrival information, presenting condition and complaint, triage, the medical screening, the continuing course of care, diagnostic and other testing, the clinical decision making about the case and the patient’s disposition.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">There is no requirement that the physician or staff who were involved with the cases must participate in the QIO meeting.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Practice Tip:</span> The hospital should not assume that the QIO has a complete copy of the patient medical records, even if the hospital has provided the entire medical record to the EMTALA survey team.<br /><br /><span class="CharOverride-2">Case Example:</span> In a QIO 60-day review regarding the appropriateness of a medical screening examination, QIO reported at the meeting that it did not have a copy of the emergency department physician’s dictated patient report, even though the report had been provided to the survey team and quoted in the Statement of Deficiencies issued by CMS.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"></a>Additional Information</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If the meeting with the QIO reveals additional information that was not reviewed by the QIO or is helpful to the hospital’s case, the hospital should request the opportunity to submit the additional information after the meeting. The additional information must usually be submitted within five days of the meeting.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"></a>Final Report</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The final QIO report must be submitted to CMS within 60 days of the QIO notice, and include expert medical opinion as to whether:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">The patient had an emergency medical condition;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The condition was stabilized;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The patient was transferred appropriately; and</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">There were other medical utilization or quality-of-care issues involved in the case.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> In the transmittal letter from the QIO, the physician or the hospital is usually offered an opportunity to request that CMS release the final QIO report to the physician or hospital. Hospitals should calendar the time to submit a request for the final report from the CMS regional office. The final report should be reviewed by the hospital and legal counsel to assess the strengths or weaknesses of the cases that may be considered by the OIG for imposition of sanctions for one or more EMTALA violations.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"></a>Failure to Receive a QIO Review</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In the <a id="_idIndexMarker017"></a><span class="Italic">St. Anthony Hospital</span> case (discussed in chapter 7, “Obligations of Receiving Hospitals”), the receiving hospital raised a procedural objection to the imposition of monetary penalties based on the failure by the OIG to obtain a QIO review before the OIG initiated the sanctions process. The court found that the QIO review was a mandatory obligation of the OIG, and that the failure to provide the review has the potential to prejudice the hospital under investigation. However, the court upheld the Departmental Appeals Board decision, stating that it excluded the QIO’s analysis of the case in its consideration of the hospital’s appeal.</p>

In the typical case, OIG will notify the hospital or physician of the alleged violations, request the submission of additional information to respond to the allegations and invite settlement discussions.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">If the hospital or physician disputes the allegations, or is unable to settle the matter with the OIG, the case may be submitted for a hearing before an administrative law judge of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and ultimately appealed to the federal courts. In the <span class="Italic">St. Anthony Hospital</span> case (discussed in chapter 7, “Obligations of Receiving Hospitals”), the appeals court stated that a hospital must “negligently” violate EMTALA in order to support the imposition of civil money penalties.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"></a>Are settlement agreements with the OIG available to the public?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">Once executed, a settlement agreement is subject to public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.

The typical OCR letter requests policies and procedures for emergency services, patient transfers, hospital admissions, ambulatory clinics and patient payment practices (such as deposits and alternative arrangements). The letter also requests the hospital to describe its service area, state whether the hospital participates in Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payer programs, report whether the hospital places limits on its services to patients and confirm the locations where the hospital has posted the Hill-Burton community service notices. OCR usually gives the hospital 30 days to respond to the request for documents and information.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker019"></a>What are the sanctions under state laws for patient-dumping?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">Some states have adopted penalties for violation of state anti-dumping laws. For example, under California law, hospitals are subject to a civil money penalty of up to $25,000 per violation, and possible suspension or loss of an emergency medical services permit. Hospitals are regulated by CDPH, but any violation by a hospital that is owned and operated by a licensed health care service plan (such as Kaiser) with respect to a plan member must be referred to the Department of Managed Health Care for enforcement.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">Physicians are subject to a civil money penalty of up to $5,000 per violation, with credit for fines paid to the federal government under EMTALA. Enforcement actions against physicians are the responsibility of the Medical Board of California. The Board may impose a fine if it finds that:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-7">The violation was knowing or willful;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-7">The violation was reasonably likely to result in a medical hazard; or</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-7">There were repeated violations.</li></ol></li></ol></li>

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The state fines may not duplicate federal fines. The state is required to credit a hospital or a physician for amounts paid as federal fines. The imposition of civil money fines may be appealed administratively (including an informal conference). If contested, the attorney general may bring action to enforce fines, with the burden of proof on the state to prove the violation and the appropriateness of the fine. If fines are dismissed or reduced, the administrative records must reflect the dismissal or reduction. In lieu of judicial review, the dispute may be submitted to arbitration.</p>

				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"></a>Can a violation of state law also constitute “immediate jeopardy” and be grounds for licensing sanctions?</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Yes. If in the course of an EMTALA or state survey, the surveyors identify practices, actions or errors that constitute “immediate jeopardy” under California law, CDPH may initiate penalties that are permitted under the California Health and Safety Code. Under California law, “immediate jeopardy” is defined as “a situation in which the licensee’s noncompliance with one or more requirements of licensure has caused, or is likely to cause, serious injury or death to the patient.”</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Examples of immediate jeopardy sanctions that have been issued for emergency service obligations include the failure to maintain an appropriate roster of on-call physicians, the failure to ensure an appropriate and readily accessible supply of emergency drugs, and medication errors that may constitute an “adverse event.”</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Further information on administrative penalties for incidents constituting “immediate jeopardy” can be found in CHA’s <span class="Italic">California Hospital Survey Manual</span>. In addition to explaining the potential penalties under California law, the guide explains who the surveyors are, which laws they assess compliance with and how they conduct a survey.
