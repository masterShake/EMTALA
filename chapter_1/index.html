				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor002"></a>Emtala Overview And History  <ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor003"></a>The EMTALA Statute  <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) was enacted by Congress as a part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 to ensure access to emergency services. The statute was amended in 1988, 1989, 2003 and 2011. EMTALA applies to anyone who presents for emergency services to a hospital that participates in the Medicare program (including psychiatric hospitals). The EMTALA statute is included as Appendix A. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">EMTALA was enacted in response to studies that found that indigent emergency patients had been turned away from hospitals for necessary services or transferred (i.e., "dumped") to public and charity hospitals in an unstabilized condition. Although EMTALA was passed to mandate access to emergency services by the indigent, Congress applied the EMTALA requirements to all patients regardless of financial or insurance status. In general, both the federal regulatory agencies and the courts have defined the primary objectives of EMTALA as twofold: to enhance access by all persons to emergency services and to prohibit <a id="_idIndexMarker000"></a>discrimination in the provision of emergency services to persons presenting with the same or similar types of conditions. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"></a>The EMTALA Regulations <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The initial EMTALA regulations were published in draft form in 1988, and issued as interim final regulations on June 22, 1994. On April 7, 2000, the regulations were amended to apply the EMTALA obligations to off-campus hospital services. In September 2003, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (<a id="_idIndexMarker001"></a>CMS) published further changes to the EMTALA regulations, repealing part of the 2000 regulations and clarifying the application of EMTALA to emergency patients, outpatients and inpatients. Since 2004, CMS has amended the EMTALA regulations in piecemeal fashion in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. The current regulations are included as Appendix B. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>The EMTALA <span class="CharOverride-1">Interpretive Guidelines</span> <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker002"></a>CMS has adopted <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> as part of the <span class="Italic">Medicare State Operations Manual</span> to provide guidance for federal and state surveyors in their enforcement of EMTALA. Although the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> are not regulations, they are considered the official interpretation of EMTALA by CMS and are used by California Department of Public Health (CDPH) surveyors and CMS regional offices in enforcement of the EMTALA obligations. The most recent update to the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> was July 16, 2010; the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> are included as Appendix C. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="All-Caps-Bold">Note:</span> The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> are organized by "<a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a>tag numbers," each of which corresponds to a CMS regulation that establishes the rules for EMTALA. The tag numbers beginning with the letter "A" are applicable to hospitals and the tag numbers beginning with the letter "C" are applicable to <a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a>critical access hospitals. Each tag number has four digits, with the number "2" at the beginning of each tag number. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker005"></a>Special Advisory Bulletins and Other Guidance <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">In November 1999, CMS and the <a id="_idIndexMarker006"></a>Office of Inspector General (OIG) released a final Special Advisory Bulletin on EMTALA and managed care. The Bulletin discusses the rules on seeking health plan authorization prior to the medical screening examination (which were added to the EMTALA regulations in 2003), dual staffing of emergency departments and recommended patient registration practices to minimize violations of EMTALA. The Bulletin is discussed in chapter 4, "Financial Considerations â€” EMTALA and Managed Care," and is included as Appendix H. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">From time to time, CMS issues Program Memoranda on various subjects relating to EMTALA obligations. Most of these memoranda have been incorporated into the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span><span class="Italic"> </span>(Appendix C). This manual includes the latest CMS guidance on critical access hospital on-call compliance with EMTALA (Appendix Y), conflicting payor requirements (Appendix X), and Ebola implications for EMTALA (Appendix AA). These memoranda are also described in detail in applicable chapters of this manual. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>Enforcement and Penalties <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The EMTALA obligations are a condition of the Medicare provider agreement (rather than a Condition of Participation), thereby permitting CMS to terminate a provider upon a confirmed violation of EMTALA. As described in chapter 13, "Regulatory Enforcement of EMTALA," the federal agencies charged with ensuring EMTALA compliance are CMS and the OIG. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">CMS has the authority to conduct complaint and enforcement surveys for EMTALA compliance, and to terminate a hospitalâ€™s Medicare provider agreement upon confirming one or more violations of EMTALA. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Under the EMTALA statute (Appendix A), the OIG has the authority to impose civil money penalties up to $50,000 against hospitals and physicians ($25,000 for hospitals with less than 100 beds), an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r to exclude a hospital or physician from the Medicare and Medicaid programs for violations of EMTALA that are "gross and flagrant or repeated." In December 2016, the OIG issued final regulations updating the amount of civil money penalties, including EMTALA fines. Effective in 2017, the OIG may now impose civil penalties up to $104,826 against hospitals and physicians ($52,414 for hospitals with less than 100 beds) for an EMTALA violation. The maximum amount of the fines is subject to annual adjustment for inflation. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The regional <a id="_idIndexMarker007"></a>quality improvement organization (QIO) is responsible for assisting CMS and OIG review patient stabilization and other medical matters pertaining to the delivery of emergency care and services. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">For hospitals that have community service obligations under the <a id="_idIndexMarker008"></a>Hill-Burton Act, the <a id="_idIndexMarker009"></a>Office for Civil Rights (OCR) will follow up on violations of EMTALA confirmed by CMS with a request for copies of EMTALA compliance, transfer, admission and other hospital policies.  </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>EMTALA Committees and Reports </li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Since 2001, there have been a number of committees and governmental agencies that have issued reports on EMTALA, including reports regarding compliance by hospitals and physicians with EMTALA standards, the enforcement process and the overall effect of the law. </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker010"></a>Office of Inspector General </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In January 2001, the OIG released two reports on EMTALA: "Survey of Hospital Emergency Departments" and "The Enforcement Process." </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIGâ€™s "Survey of Hospital Emergency Departments" made the following findings: </p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Emergency department personnel are familiar with the EMTALA requirements, but many are unaware of recent policy changes. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Training increases EMTALA familiarity for all staff; unfortunately, on-call specialists and staff in high-volume emergency departments are less likely to receive training. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Hospital staff report that hospitals generally comply with EMTALA, but some express concerns about compliance. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Hospital staff believe that some aspects of EMTALA are unclear or questionable. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Hospital staff believe that while EMTALA may help protect patients, it also may contribute to a hospitalâ€™s administrative and financial problems. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Investigations, many of which do not confirm violations, often prompt changes in forms and procedures. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Managed care creates special problems for hospitals in complying with EMTALA. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Hospitals have difficulty staffing on-call panels for some specialists. </li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIG report made three conclusions: </p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">CMS should use a variety of methods to communicate important policy changes, including e-mail and the Internet. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">CMS should support legislation that compels managed care plans to reimburse hospitals for EMTALA-related services, including screening exams that do not reveal the presence of an emergency medical condition. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Uncompensated care and on-call panels are very complex problems that may require action at the federal, state and local levels, as well as by private entities. </li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIG reported that CMS concurred with its recommendations. </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In "The Enforcement Process" report, the OIG issued the following findings on the EMTALA enforcement process: </p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">The EMTALA enforcement process is compromised by long delays and inadequate feedback. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The number of EMTALA investigations and their ultimate disposition vary widely by CMS region and year. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Poor tracking of EMTALA cases impede oversight. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Peer review is not always obtained before CMS considers terminating a hospital for medical reasons. </li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIG report recommended that CMS increase its oversight of the regional offices, improve collection and access to EMTALA data, ensure that peer review occurs for cases involving medical judgment, and establish an EMTALA technical advisory group. The OIG reported that CMS concurred with its recommendations. </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker011"></a>General Accountability Office </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In June 2001, the U.S. General Accountability Office (GAO) released its own report entitled "EMTALA Implementation and Enforcement Issues." Among other findings, the GAO reported that providers generally support the goals of EMTALA, but are uncertain about the extent of their obligations and have concerns about its effects on emergency care. In Table 1 of the report, the GAO listed seven issues identified as provider uncertainties: </p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">Scope of the medical screening exam </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Definition of patient stability for transfer </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Obligations for post-hospital care </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List"><a id="_idIndexMarker012"></a>Application of the 250-yard rule </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Obligations related to patients in other hospital departments </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Requirement for on-call coverage </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Compliance with local emergency medical systems for routing of ambulances </li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The comments by CMS on those issues are addressed in various sections of this manual. </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Regarding the enforcement of EMTALA, the GAO reported that most EMTALA violations involve failure to screen, stabilize or transfer appropriately. They noted that although hospitals have concerns about CMS enforcement, CMS usually accepts corrective action plans and rarely terminates hospitals from the Medicare program. Finally, the GAO found that the OIG focuses on future compliance in assessing fines for EMTALA violations, and generally does not pursue a physician in the absence of clearly culpable behavior. The GAO endorsed many of the OIG recommendations in the two earlier reports discussed above. </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In April 2009, the GAO issued a report entitled "Hospital Emergency Departments â€” Crowding Continues to Occur, and Some Patients Wait Longer than Recommended Time Frames." The report looked at indicators of emergency department crowding, including ambulance diversion, wait times and patient boarding. The report determined that the primary factor for emergency department crowding is the lack of inpatient beds, with the following secondary factors: lack of access to primary care, a shortage of available on-call specialists and difficulties with transferring or discharging psychiatric patients. The report, "GAO-09-347," can be accessed on the GAO website at <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09347.pdf">www.gao.go<span class="No-break">v/n</span>ew.item<span class="No-break">s/</span><span class="No-break">d</span>09347.pdf</a>. </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a>EMTALA <a id="_idIndexMarker013"></a>Technical Advisory Group </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In the 2003 Medicare reform legislation, Congress directed the Secretary of HHS to establish a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to solicit advice concerning the EMTALA regulations and enforcement. The Secretary signed the charter establishing the TAG on May 11, 2004; the TAG had a term of 30 months. The TAG was composed of 19 members, including four hospital representatives and seven physicians. The final meeting of the TAG was Sept. 17-18, 2007. </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The TAG had the following responsibilities: </p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">Review the EMTALA regulations; </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Provide advice and recommendations to the Secretary concerning the regulations and their application to hospitals and physicians; </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Solicit comments and recommendations from providers and the public regarding the implementation of the regulations; and </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Disseminate information on the EMTALA regulations to providers and the public. </li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">During its tenure, the TAG issued seven reports and made several recommendations to CMS, some of which resulted in changes to the regulations and others in updated guidance issued in Program Memoranda. At its final meeting, the TAG adopted a series of recommendations related to accepting hospital obligations, clarification of conditions that constitute an "emergency medical condition," clarification of the term "stabilization" (including a proposed concept of "temporary stabilization"), and procedures and criteria for transferring patients with stabilized conditions to physician offices for follow-up evaluation and care. It is uncertain whether these recommendations will be accepted by CMS, and if so, whether there will be any changes. </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Further information on the TAG, including meeting agendas and reports, is available on the CMS website at <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/EMTALA/03_emtalatag.asp">www.cms.hhs.go<span class="No-break">v/E</span>MTAL<span class="No-break">A/0</span>3_emtalatag.asp</a>. </p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"></a>EMTALA Compliance <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Hospitals should adopt a hospital-wide policy that commits the facility to comply with EMTALA, as well as quality improvement, risk management and corporate compliance programs to monitor adherence with EMTALA standards. A model policy is included as Appendix O. Other recommended EMTALA policies are discussed throughout this manual and are listed in Appendix N. </p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker014"></a>State Laws <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The EMTALA statute expressly provides that the federal obligations do not preempt state and local emergency laws unless they conflict with the EMTALA obligations. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Some states have adopted emergency services statutes or regulations. Readers of this manual should consult with their legal counsel as to the effect of these laws. (Relevant California laws are discussed in this manual.) </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">In 1987, the California Legislature amended the hospital licensing laws to enact state patient anti-dumping laws. The California emergency medical service requirements are similar to EMTALA requirements, with some exceptions that are discussed in this manual. The following are some examples: </p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">California law applies to hospitals that are licensed to provide emergency services; EMTALA applies to all hospitals that provide emergency services, even if they do not have licensed emergency departments. </li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">California law expressly prohibits <a id="_idIndexMarker015"></a>discrimination in the provision of emergency services by hospitals and physicians. </li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">EMTALA focuses on whether a patient with an emergency condition is "stabilized" for transfer or discharge; California law primarily focuses on transfers that are made for nonmedical reasons (e.g., insurance or financial reasons), which apply to patients with emergency conditions that are considered to be stabilized. California law does not apply to a transfer that is made for medical reasons (although other state requirements pertaining to the transfer of patients may apply). </li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The California licensing laws on "emergency services and care" are included as Appendix D. </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The EMTALA regulations contain a series of defined terms that are essential to the regulatory scheme. The key terms defined below are based on definitions in the EMTALA statute or regulations, except for a number of terms defined by California law that are so indicated. Readers of this manual in other states should consult with their legal counsel as to state laws and regulations that define other terms that are applicable to emergency services rendered in their state. </p>

						<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor002"></a>Emtala Overview And History  <ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor003"></a>The EMTALA Statute  <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) was enacted by Congress as a part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 to ensure access to emergency services. The statute was amended in 1988, 1989, 2003 and 2011. EMTALA applies to anyone who presents for emergency services to a hospital that participates in the Medicare program (including psychiatric hospitals). The EMTALA statute is included as Appendix A. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">EMTALA was enacted in response to studies that found that indigent emergency patients had been turned away from hospitals for necessary services or transferred (i.e., "dumped") to public and charity hospitals in an unstabilized condition. Although EMTALA was passed to mandate access to emergency services by the indigent, Congress applied the EMTALA requirements to all patients regardless of financial or insurance status. In general, both the federal regulatory agencies and the courts have defined the primary objectives of EMTALA as twofold: to enhance access by all persons to emergency services and to prohibit <a id="_idIndexMarker000"></a>discrimination in the provision of emergency services to persons presenting with the same or similar types of conditions. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"></a>The EMTALA Regulations <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The initial EMTALA regulations were published in draft form in 1988, and issued as interim final regulations on June 22, 1994. On April 7, 2000, the regulations were amended to apply the EMTALA obligations to off-campus hospital services. In September 2003, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (<a id="_idIndexMarker001"></a>CMS) published further changes to the EMTALA regulations, repealing part of the 2000 regulations and clarifying the application of EMTALA to emergency patients, outpatients and inpatients. Since 2004, CMS has amended the EMTALA regulations in piecemeal fashion in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. The current regulations are included as Appendix B. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>The EMTALA <span class="CharOverride-1">Interpretive Guidelines</span> <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker002"></a>CMS has adopted <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> as part of the <span class="Italic">Medicare State Operations Manual</span> to provide guidance for federal and state surveyors in their enforcement of EMTALA. Although the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> are not regulations, they are considered the official interpretation of EMTALA by CMS and are used by California Department of Public Health (CDPH) surveyors and CMS regional offices in enforcement of the EMTALA obligations. The most recent update to the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> was July 16, 2010; the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> are included as Appendix C. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="All-Caps-Bold">Note:</span> The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> are organized by "<a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a>tag numbers," each of which corresponds to a CMS regulation that establishes the rules for EMTALA. The tag numbers beginning with the letter "A" are applicable to hospitals and the tag numbers beginning with the letter "C" are applicable to <a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a>critical access hospitals. Each tag number has four digits, with the number "2" at the beginning of each tag number. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker005"></a>Special Advisory Bulletins and Other Guidance <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">In November 1999, CMS and the <a id="_idIndexMarker006"></a>Office of Inspector General (OIG) released a final Special Advisory Bulletin on EMTALA and managed care. The Bulletin discusses the rules on seeking health plan authorization prior to the medical screening examination (which were added to the EMTALA regulations in 2003), dual staffing of emergency departments and recommended patient registration practices to minimize violations of EMTALA. The Bulletin is discussed in chapter 4, "Financial Considerations â€” EMTALA and Managed Care," and is included as Appendix H. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">From time to time, CMS issues Program Memoranda on various subjects relating to EMTALA obligations. Most of these memoranda have been incorporated into the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span><span class="Italic"> </span>(Appendix C). This manual includes the latest CMS guidance on critical access hospital on-call compliance with EMTALA (Appendix Y), conflicting payor requirements (Appendix X), and Ebola implications for EMTALA (Appendix AA). These memoranda are also described in detail in applicable chapters of this manual. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>Enforcement and Penalties <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The EMTALA obligations are a condition of the Medicare provider agreement (rather than a Condition of Participation), thereby permitting CMS to terminate a provider upon a confirmed violation of EMTALA. As described in chapter 13, "Regulatory Enforcement of EMTALA," the federal agencies charged with ensuring EMTALA compliance are CMS and the OIG. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">CMS has the authority to conduct complaint and enforcement surveys for EMTALA compliance, and to terminate a hospitalâ€™s Medicare provider agreement upon confirming one or more violations of EMTALA. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Under the EMTALA statute (Appendix A), the OIG has the authority to impose civil money penalties up to $50,000 against hospitals and physicians ($25,000 for hospitals with less than 100 beds), an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r to exclude a hospital or physician from the Medicare and Medicaid programs for violations of EMTALA that are "gross and flagrant or repeated." In December 2016, the OIG issued final regulations updating the amount of civil money penalties, including EMTALA fines. Effective in 2017, the OIG may now impose civil penalties up to $104,826 against hospitals and physicians ($52,414 for hospitals with less than 100 beds) for an EMTALA violation. The maximum amount of the fines is subject to annual adjustment for inflation. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The regional <a id="_idIndexMarker007"></a>quality improvement organization (QIO) is responsible for assisting CMS and OIG review patient stabilization and other medical matters pertaining to the delivery of emergency care and services. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">For hospitals that have community service obligations under the <a id="_idIndexMarker008"></a>Hill-Burton Act, the <a id="_idIndexMarker009"></a>Office for Civil Rights (OCR) will follow up on violations of EMTALA confirmed by CMS with a request for copies of EMTALA compliance, transfer, admission and other hospital policies.  </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>EMTALA Committees and Reports <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Since 2001, there have been a number of committees and governmental agencies that have issued reports on EMTALA, including reports regarding compliance by hospitals and physicians with EMTALA standards, the enforcement process and the overall effect of the law. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker010"></a>Office of Inspector General </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In January 2001, the OIG released two reports on EMTALA: "Survey of Hospital Emergency Departments" and "The Enforcement Process." </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIGâ€™s "Survey of Hospital Emergency Departments" made the following findings: </p><ol>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Emergency department personnel are familiar with the EMTALA requirements, but many are unaware of recent policy changes. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Training increases EMTALA familiarity for all staff; unfortunately, on-call specialists and staff in high-volume emergency departments are less likely to receive training. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Hospital staff report that hospitals generally comply with EMTALA, but some express concerns about compliance. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Hospital staff believe that some aspects of EMTALA are unclear or questionable. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Hospital staff believe that while EMTALA may help protect patients, it also may contribute to a hospitalâ€™s administrative and financial problems. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Investigations, many of which do not confirm violations, often prompt changes in forms and procedures. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Managed care creates special problems for hospitals in complying with EMTALA. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Hospitals have difficulty staffing on-call panels for some specialists. </li>
					</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIG report made three conclusions: </p><ol>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">CMS should use a variety of methods to communicate important policy changes, including e-mail and the Internet. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">CMS should support legislation that compels managed care plans to reimburse hospitals for EMTALA-related services, including screening exams that do not reveal the presence of an emergency medical condition. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Uncompensated care and on-call panels are very complex problems that may require action at the federal, state and local levels, as well as by private entities. </li>
					</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIG reported that CMS concurred with its recommendations. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In "The Enforcement Process" report, the OIG issued the following findings on the EMTALA enforcement process: </p><ol>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">The EMTALA enforcement process is compromised by long delays and inadequate feedback. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The number of EMTALA investigations and their ultimate disposition vary widely by CMS region and year. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Poor tracking of EMTALA cases impede oversight. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Peer review is not always obtained before CMS considers terminating a hospital for medical reasons. </li>
					</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIG report recommended that CMS increase its oversight of the regional offices, improve collection and access to EMTALA data, ensure that peer review occurs for cases involving medical judgment, and establish an EMTALA technical advisory group. The OIG reported that CMS concurred with its recommendations. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker011"></a>General Accountability Office </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In June 2001, the U.S. General Accountability Office (GAO) released its own report entitled "EMTALA Implementation and Enforcement Issues." Among other findings, the GAO reported that providers generally support the goals of EMTALA, but are uncertain about the extent of their obligations and have concerns about its effects on emergency care. In Table 1 of the report, the GAO listed seven issues identified as provider uncertainties: </p><ol>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">Scope of the medical screening exam </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Definition of patient stability for transfer </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Obligations for post-hospital care </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List"><a id="_idIndexMarker012"></a>Application of the 250-yard rule </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Obligations related to patients in other hospital departments </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Requirement for on-call coverage </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Compliance with local emergency medical systems for routing of ambulances </li>
					</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The comments by CMS on those issues are addressed in various sections of this manual. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Regarding the enforcement of EMTALA, the GAO reported that most EMTALA violations involve failure to screen, stabilize or transfer appropriately. They noted that although hospitals have concerns about CMS enforcement, CMS usually accepts corrective action plans and rarely terminates hospitals from the Medicare program. Finally, the GAO found that the OIG focuses on future compliance in assessing fines for EMTALA violations, and generally does not pursue a physician in the absence of clearly culpable behavior. The GAO endorsed many of the OIG recommendations in the two earlier reports discussed above. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In April 2009, the GAO issued a report entitled "Hospital Emergency Departments â€” Crowding Continues to Occur, and Some Patients Wait Longer than Recommended Time Frames." The report looked at indicators of emergency department crowding, including ambulance diversion, wait times and patient boarding. The report determined that the primary factor for emergency department crowding is the lack of inpatient beds, with the following secondary factors: lack of access to primary care, a shortage of available on-call specialists and difficulties with transferring or discharging psychiatric patients. The report, "GAO-09-347," can be accessed on the GAO website at <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09347.pdf" target="_system">www.gao.go<span class="No-break">v/n</span>ew.item<span class="No-break">s/</span><span class="No-break">d</span>09347.pdf</a>. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a>EMTALA <a id="_idIndexMarker013"></a>Technical Advisory Group </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In the 2003 Medicare reform legislation, Congress directed the Secretary of HHS to establish a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to solicit advice concerning the EMTALA regulations and enforcement. The Secretary signed the charter establishing the TAG on May 11, 2004; the TAG had a term of 30 months. The TAG was composed of 19 members, including four hospital representatives and seven physicians. The final meeting of the TAG was Sept. 17-18, 2007. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The TAG had the following responsibilities: </p><ol>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">Review the EMTALA regulations; </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Provide advice and recommendations to the Secretary concerning the regulations and their application to hospitals and physicians; </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Solicit comments and recommendations from providers and the public regarding the implementation of the regulations; and </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Disseminate information on the EMTALA regulations to providers and the public. </li>
					</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">During its tenure, the TAG issued seven reports and made several recommendations to CMS, some of which resulted in changes to the regulations and others in updated guidance issued in Program Memoranda. At its final meeting, the TAG adopted a series of recommendations related to accepting hospital obligations, clarification of conditions that constitute an "emergency medical condition," clarification of the term "stabilization" (including a proposed concept of "temporary stabilization"), and procedures and criteria for transferring patients with stabilized conditions to physician offices for follow-up evaluation and care. It is uncertain whether these recommendations will be accepted by CMS, and if so, whether there will be any changes. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Further information on the TAG, including meeting agendas and reports, is available on the CMS website at <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/EMTALA/03_emtalatag.asp" target="_system">www.cms.hhs.go<span class="No-break">v/E</span>MTAL<span class="No-break">A/0</span>3_emtalatag.asp</a>. </p></li></ol></li>
					<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"></a>EMTALA Compliance <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Hospitals should adopt a hospital-wide policy that commits the facility to comply with EMTALA, as well as quality improvement, risk management and corporate compliance programs to monitor adherence with EMTALA standards. A model policy is included as Appendix O. Other recommended EMTALA policies are discussed throughout this manual and are listed in Appendix N. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker014"></a>State Laws <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The EMTALA statute expressly provides that the federal obligations do not preempt state and local emergency laws unless they conflict with the EMTALA obligations. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Some states have adopted emergency services statutes or regulations. Readers of this manual should consult with their legal counsel as to the effect of these laws. (Relevant California laws are discussed in this manual.) </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">In 1987, the California Legislature amended the hospital licensing laws to enact state patient anti-dumping laws. The California emergency medical service requirements are similar to EMTALA requirements, with some exceptions that are discussed in this manual. The following are some examples: </p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">California law applies to hospitals that are licensed to provide emergency services; EMTALA applies to all hospitals that provide emergency services, even if they do not have licensed emergency departments. </li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">California law expressly prohibits <a id="_idIndexMarker015"></a>discrimination in the provision of emergency services by hospitals and physicians. </li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">EMTALA focuses on whether a patient with an emergency condition is "stabilized" for transfer or discharge; California law primarily focuses on transfers that are made for nonmedical reasons (e.g., insurance or financial reasons), which apply to patients with emergency conditions that are considered to be stabilized. California law does not apply to a transfer that is made for medical reasons (although other state requirements pertaining to the transfer of patients may apply). </li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The California licensing laws on "emergency services and care" are included as Appendix D. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The EMTALA regulations contain a series of defined terms that are essential to the regulatory scheme. The key terms defined below are based on definitions in the EMTALA statute or regulations, except for a number of terms defined by California law that are so indicated.

In addition, EMTALA does not apply to hospital-owned suppliers of Medicare services that are billed separately from hospital services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Indent-1 _idGenParaOverride-3">In some instances, a hospital company may operate <a id="_idIndexMarker008"></a>clinics that are separately licensed or exempt from licensing. Examples of licensed clinics in California include "community clinics" and "surgical clinics," both of which are subject to clinic licensing laws, and are listed on the hospital license or subject to hospital regulations. Examples of clinics that are exempt from licensing include primary care clinics operated by counties or other public agencies, clinics affiliated with teaching institutions, medical care foundation clinics and imaging centers.

The term intended to distinguish between hospital departments that are held out as services for persons with urgent and emergency medical problems and other hospital departments   that primarily serve scheduled outpatients for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. As discussed below, the distinction is not always clear to providers and patients.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">A <span class="Bold">"dedicated emergency department"</span> is defined in the EMTALA regulations as a hospital department or facility that is located on the hospital campus or <a id="_idIndexMarker010"></a>off-campus, and meets any one of the following tests:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idIndexMarker011"></a><span class="Bold">License Test.</span> The department or facility is licensed by the state in which it is located as an emergency room or department;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idIndexMarker012"></a><span class="Bold">Holding Out Test.</span> The department or facility is held out to the public (by name, signs, advertising or other means) as a place that provides care for emergency medical conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment; or</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idIndexMarker013"></a><span class="Bold">One-Third Test.</span> The department or facility, based on a representative sample of patient visits within the preceding calendar year, provides at least one-third of all of its outpatient visits for the treatment of emergency medical conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment.</li></ol></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>How will CMS determine if a hospital department is a dedicated emergency department under the one-third test?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, CMS has provided guidance to the CMS regional offices and state<a id="_idIndexMarker014"></a> survey agencies to determine whether a hospital department meets the one-third test. The surveyor is directed to select a sample of patient visits to the department that occurred during the previous calendar year. The surveyor will review the facility log, appointment   roster and other appropriate information to identify the patients seen in the department or facility. The surveyor will then review 20 to 50 medical records of patients for diagnoses or presenting complaints; in consultation with the CMS regional office, the surveyor may expand the sample size in order to conduct an adequate investigation. The patient sample will be selected by the surveyor, not the hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The surveyor must then determine the number of patients who "had an emergency medical condition and received stabilizing treatment." If one-third of the sample cases were for the treatment of emergency conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment, the department or facility will be considered to be a dedicated emergency department. The Investigative Procedures for EMTALA Surveyors portion of   the <span class="Italic">State Operations Manual</span> (Appendix K) notes that this procedure will apply to specialty hospitals (e.g., <a id="_idIndexMarker015"></a>psychiatric facilities), hospitals without a traditional emergency department, and <a id="_idIndexMarker016"></a>urgent care centers. In addition, the procedure may apply to both on-campus and off- campus departments and facilities of the hospital.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Are <a id="_idIndexMarker017"></a>labor and delivery and <a id="_idIndexMarker018"></a>psychiatric services considered dedicated emergency departments under EMTALA?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the preamble to the 2003 regulations, CMS reaffirmed that a dedicated emergency department includes not only what is generally considered to be a hospitalâ€™s "emergency room," but also other departments of hospitals, such as labor and delivery and psychiatric units. As stated by CMS:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-8">Any area of the hospital that offers such medical services to treat individuals in labor to at least one-third of the ambulatory individuals who present to the area for care, even if the hospitalâ€™s practice is to admit such individuals as inpatients rather than listing them on an outpatient basis, <span class="CharOverride-6">would</span> be considered a dedicated emergency department. (Emphasis in original) [68 Fed. Reg. 53229]</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In recent years, CMS has been closely looking at freestanding acute psychiatric hospitals to determine whether they operate dedicated emergency departments for "walk-in" or other non-scheduled patients.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a>Are hospital urgent care centers and other ambulatory departments dedicated emergency departments under EMTALA?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idIndexMarker019"></a>In the preamble to the 2003 regulations, CMS rejected a request to exclude hospital urgent care centers from the EMTALA requirements, stating:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-8">We believe that it would be very difficult for any individual in need of emergency care to distinguish between a hospital department that provides care for an â€˜urgent needâ€™ and one that provides care for an â€˜emergency medical conditionâ€™ need ... . As we have discussed above, if the department or facility is held out    to the public as a place that provides care for emergency medical conditions, it would meet the definition of dedicated emergency department. An urgent care center of this kind would fall under this criterion for dedicated emergency department status [68 Fed. Reg. 53431].</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">However, other guidance from CMS suggests that urgent care and other hospital departments that provide drop-in services for urgent and non-urgent conditions are not automatically considered to be dedicated emergency departments. For example, as noted above, the Investigative Procedures for EMTALA Surveyors portion of the <span class="Italic">State Operations Manual </span>states that the procedure to apply the "one-third test" may apply to an urgent care center or other hospital department only if more than one-third of the centerâ€™s or departmentâ€™s patients presented for the treatment of "emergency" conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment. The guidance suggests that patients presenting only for treatment of "urgent" or "non-urgent" conditions on a drop-in basis will not result in the classification of the urgent care center or other department as a dedicated emergency department.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In addition, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> adopted to implement the Medicare Conditions of Participation for hospital outpatient services [42 C.F.R. Section 482.55] note that urgent care clinics may be organized as part of an <a id="_idIndexMarker020"></a>outpatient department or an emergency department. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> then state that an urgent care clinic will be evaluated for compliance with the integration standards for outpatient services (rather than the integration standards for emergency departments) if three conditions are met:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The urgent care clinic is held out to the public as providing only urgent care services and possibly other services;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The hospital clearly advises the public that the urgent care clinic is not an emergency department; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The urgent care clinic does not meet the definition of a dedicated emergency department under EMTALA.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In some states, urgent care centers and similar departments are licensed as outpatient services. For example, in California, an outpatient service is defined as "the rendering of nonemergency health care" to patients [Title 22, California Code of Regulations, Section 70525].</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As indicated in this discussion, there is some confusion as to whether urgent care centers and similar drop-in hospital departments (e.g., an <a id="_idIndexMarker021"></a>occupational medicine clinic) that are not licensed or operated as typical emergency departments are dedicated emergency departments within the meaning of EMTALA. How an urgent care center is held out to the public may be a critical factor in whether an urgent care center is treated as a dedicated emergency department or excepted from EMTALA. This is illustrated in a 2016 court decision that focused on the signage for a hospital-operated urgent care center. The hospital argued that its website clearly stated that its urgent care center was for non-emergency  needs. However, the court noted that the on-site signage for the urgent care center did not distinguish between urgent care and emergent care; therefore, a person driving by the urgent care center (in this instance, with chest pains) would be unlikely to check the website before entering the urgent care center. As a result, the court declined to rule in favor of the hospital based on the patientâ€™s perception from the signage that the clinic would be an appropriate place to receive emergency care. This case, <span class="Italic">Friedrich et at. v. South County Hospital Healthcare System, et al.</span>, is discussed in chapter 14.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> The broad definition of dedicated emergency department requires  a hospital to evaluate all of its ambulatory care departments (on- and off-campus) to identify the services that meet the definition of a dedicated emergency department. In addition to reviewing the volume of drop-in patients, the hospital should also review its website, signage, advertising, other promotional materials, and information disseminated to the public regarding the availability of drop-in services.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a>How does EMTALA apply to a hospital that does not have a dedicated emergency department?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The first subsection of the EMTALA statute triggers the medical screening obligation for an individual who comes to a "hospital that has an emergency department."

The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> indicate that hospitals that do not provide emergency services must meet the standards of the Medicare Conditions of Participation [42 C.F.R. Section 482.12(f)(2); <span class="Italic">see Appendix E</span>], which require all participating hospitals to have written <a id="_idIndexMarker022"></a>policies and procedures for the appraisal of emergencies, initial treatment within the capability and capacity of the hospital, and appropriate referral of emergency patients to hospitals that are capable of providing the necessary emergency services. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> for Section 482.12(f) require that staff at any hospital location know how to respond to individuals (patients, staff, visitors and others) seeking or in need of medical and psychiatric emergency services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> state that a hospital with a dedicated emergency department  must comply with the medical screening, stabilizing treatment, transfer and other obligations of EMTALA. However, all hospitals participating in the Medicare program, regardless of maintaining a dedicated emergency department, are subject to the Medicare receiving hospital obligation, and must accept an appropriate transfer of an individual with an emergency medical condition who requires specialized capabilities not available at the transferring hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Hospitals (including critical access hospitals) that do not have a physician present in the hospital on a full-time basis must provide a written <a id="_idIndexMarker023"></a>notice to all patients at the beginning of their hospital stay or outpatient visit stating that a physician is not present in the hospital 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The notice must explain how the hospital will meet the medical needs of a patient who develops an emergency medical condition during the course of an inpatient stay or outpatient encounter at a time when no physician is present in the hospital. The law states that an inpatient stay or outpatient encounter is considered to begin with    the provision of a package of information regarding scheduled preadmission testing and registration for a planned hospital admission for inpatient care or outpatient service. Prior to admitting the patient or providing an outpatient service, the hospital must receive a signed acknowledgment from the patient indicating the patientâ€™s understanding that a physician may not be present in the hospital at all times. The notice is a condition of the Medicare provider agreement, a violation of which may result in termination of the agreement.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If a hospital does not have a dedicated emergency department, it is recommended that the hospital consult with its legal counsel to determine:</p><ol>

Instead, CMS will apply the Medicare Conditions of Participation to the examination and treatment rendered to the outpatient if the need for emergency care arises during his or her encounter.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">As an example, CMS has described the hypothetical case of an outpatient who comes  to the physical therapy department for a scheduled appointment. During the encounter, the patient experiences chest pains and lightheadedness, and is taken to the dedicated emergency department for follow-up examination and treatment. Although personnel in the dedicated emergency department may (and should) provide emergency services to the patient in the same manner as any other patient presenting to the department with similar signs and symptoms, the EMTALA obligations will not apply to the patient since the need for emergency care arose during the outpatient encounter in the physical therapy department. Instead, the response by the hospital is subject to the standards of the Medicare Conditions of Participation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">Although not expressly stated in the regulations, it appears that EMTALA applies to an outpatient if he or she requests or is in need of emergency services prior to the encounter or after the encounter is completed (e.g.,, the patient faints or has a medical crisis while leaving the hospital or in the parking lot).</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-5"><span class="Reference-mark CharOverride-3">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-3">42 C.F.R.

In some cases, the referring physician has seen the patient immediately preceding the patientâ€™s arrival at the hospital; in other cases, the physician has not seen the patient prior to his or her arrival at the hospital, but may have provided an ongoing course of treatment to the patient. Occasionally, a patient is directed to meet his or her primary care physician in the emergency department for examination or treatment.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the preamble to the 2003 regulations, CMS reaffirmed that EMTALA applies to any individual who presents to a dedicated emergency department seeking examination or treatment for any medical condition. As noted by CMS, pharmaceutical services in a dedicated emergency department may be for medical conditions, and are therefore subject to EMTALA [68 Fed. Reg. 53235]. EMTALA will apply if an individual presents for injections  or other treatment for a medical condition, even if the individual arrives with orders from an attending staff member. Therefore, hospitals should record these patients in the central log, open a medical record and provide a medical screening examination.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">This position expressed by CMS in the preamble is reinforced in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>. CMS states that if a patient presents to a dedicated emergency department for pharmaceutical services for a medical condition, the hospital "generally" has an EMTALA obligation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The CMS position, however, implies that not all requests by patients presenting to a dedicated emergency department for pharmaceutical services implicate EMTALA, and therefore require a medical screening examination. However, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> do not provide sufficient guidance to determine the categories of medication requests that do not trigger the EMTALA obligations. Hospitals and their medical staffs should also consider regulatory and risk management issues when deciding whether to administer medication in the absence of a medical screening examination for patients presenting to an emergency department for pharmaceutical services. Therefore, the best practice is for hospitals to provide a medical screening examination, and other EMTALA-required services, to patients presenting for pharmaceutical services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">It is noted that EMTALA does not require a hospital to provide medication to patients who,  as a result of the medical screening examination, are determined not to have an emergency medical condition. As stated by CMS, EMTALA does not require a hospital to provide medication to a non-emergent patient "because the individual is unable to pay or does not wish to purchase the medication from a retail pharmacy or did not plan appropriately to secure prescription refills."</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">If an individual comes to a hospital department that is not a dedicated emergency department with a prescription or seeking pharmaceutical services, the EMTALA obligations will not apply to the request unless the individual requests or is in obvious need of examination or treatment for what may be an emergency medical condition. In these cases, hospitals should follow their standard policies and procedures for pharmacy services requested by nonemergency patients.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">Although the EMTALA obligations apply to all individuals who present to a dedicated emergency department, hospitals may tailor their medical screenings for patients who   present at a dedicated emergency department for nonemergency services. The scope of the examination is discussed in chapter 3, "Medical Screening Examinations."</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-5"><span class="Reference-mark CharOverride-3">F</span>	Reference:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, tag no.

However, CMS has indicated that EMTALA does not apply to individuals who present to a dedicated emergency department and request services that are not an examination or treatment for a medical condition. Some examples of these situations include the following.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker030"></a>Preventive Care Services</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the preamble to the 2003 EMTALA regulations, CMS, without explanation, listed "preventive health services" as one example of a request for services that does not trigger the requirement for a medical screening examination [68 Fed. Reg. 53235]. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> provide three examples of "preventive care services" â€” immunizations, allergy shots and flu shots.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">However, if a person presenting for these types of preventive care services requests or is in need of an examination for a medical condition, EMTALA may apply and the patient should be treated in the same manner as other patients presenting for emergency services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker031"></a>Blood Pressure Checks</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the past, CMS Region IX has suggested that EMTALA probably does not apply to persons presenting to an emergency department for routine blood pressure checks offered as a community service to all area residents.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> qualify this past advice. As explained by CMS, a hospital may  have a policy or protocol (or, as applicable, a standardized procedure) permitting a qualified professional in a dedicated emergency department to conduct medical screenings within his or her scope of practice. As an example, CMS cites a request for a blood pressure check. If a person presenting for a routine blood pressure check, upon screening, has a reading within normal limits and there are no other signs or symptoms indicating the presence of an emergency medical condition, the hospital is not required under EMTALA to provide services beyond what was needed to determine the absence of an emergency condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">However, if a person presenting for a routine blood pressure check also requests or is in need of an examination for a medical condition, EMTALA may apply and the patient should be treated in the same manner as other patients presenting for emergency services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"></a>Blood Alcohol Tests and Sexual Assault Cases</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the preamble to the 2003 regulations, CMS stated that requests by law enforcement personnel for <a id="_idIndexMarker032"></a>medical clearance of incarcerated patients, or blood alcohol or other tests to   be used as evidence in criminal proceedings, would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the hospital is required to provide a medical screening and other required EMTALA services [68 Fed. Reg. 53235].</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> provide additional direction for hospitals in law enforcement   cases. In general, the "gathering of evidence for criminal law cases (e.g., sexual assault,   blood alcohol test)" does not trigger the requirements for a medical screening examination or other EMTALA required services. However, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> qualify this exemption from EMTALA:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-8">If an individual is brought to the ED and law enforcement personnel request  that emergency department personnel draw blood for a BAT only and [do] not request examination or treatment for a medical condition, such as intoxication, and a <a id="_idIndexMarker033"></a>prudent layperson would not believe that the individual needed such examination or treatment, then the EMTALAâ€™s screening requirement is not applicable to this situation because the request made on behalf of the individual was for evidence. However, if for example, the individual in police custody was involved in a motor vehicle accident or may have sustained   injury to him or herself and presents to the ED, a MSE would be warranted to determine if an EMC exists.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> further clarify that requests for pre-jail clearance trigger the EMTALA obligations, and that hospitals should provide a medical screening examination to determine whether the individual has an emergency medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">With respect to rape and sexual assault cases, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> state that the same principle described above for blood alcohol testing also applies to individuals presenting to a dedicated emergency department in connection with rape or sexual assault.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In summary, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> direct surveyors to review each case on its own    merits to determine whether EMTALA applies to law enforcement requests. In conducting   staff in-service training, hospitals should consider that even if law enforcement personnel do not request medical care for a patient in custody, the EMTALA obligations will be triggered if a prudent layperson would believe that the patientâ€™s behavior or appearance indicates the need to provide examination or treatment for a medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">For further guidance on medical procedures requested by law enforcement, California hospitals should review chapter 6 of CHAâ€™s <span class="Italic">Consent Manual</span>.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"></a>Other Nonemergency Tests</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, CMS states that the presentation by an individual to a  dedicated emergency department for the collection of evidence (e.g., a lab test) does not trigger the EMTALA obligations so long as the request does not include analysis of the lab results or an examination or treatment of the individual.

If the ambulance still brings the individual to the hospital, the patient is considered to have "come to the emergency department" and the hospital must accept the person and provide a medical screening examination.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In a 2001 9th Circuit Court of Appeal decision, <a id="_idIndexMarker036"></a><span class="Italic">Arrington v.

In  the <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> case, a patient with "severe respiratory distress" was in a nonhospital-owned ambulance on the way to a hospital when the ambulance personnel contacted the hospital. The emergency physician asked the name of the patientâ€™s physician and told the ambulance personnel that he believed that "it would be okay" to redirect the ambulance to the patientâ€™s aligned facility (in this case, an Army medical center). The total ambulance time with change in direction was 16 minutes. As discussed in chapter 14, "Private Actions to Enforce EMTALA," the court interpreted the phrase "comes to the emergency department" as including an individual who is en route to the hospital.

The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> address the use of hospital helipads under EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">CMS states that the use of a hospital helipad by local ambulance services or other hospitals to transport a patient to a tertiary (or trauma) hospital does not trigger an EMTALA obligation for the hospital that owns the helipad if two conditions are met:</p><ol>
								<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The helipad is being used for the purpose of transit; and</li>
								<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The sending hospital has conducted a medical screening of the patient prior to transporting the patient to the helipad.</li>
							</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">However, the Guidelines state that if the ambulance crew or the patient (while on-site at the hospital with the helipad) requests the medical assistance of the hospital (e.g.,, the patientâ€™s condition has deteriorated or the patient requires intubation), the hospital must provide emergency services consistent with its EMTALA obligations. Some EMS agencies have adopted policies that include standards for a non-destination hospital to which an ambulance may divert during the course of an arranged transport to a trauma center or  other facility. These policies do not override the EMTALA obligations. If the ambulance crew or the patient requests examination or treatment at a non-destination hospital, the EMTALA obligations may apply, and the hospital must enter the patient in the central log, open a patient record, conduct a medical screening, provide treatment within its capability and reconfirm the transfer to the destination facility. In some instances, this may be a very short visit. However, there is risk of an EMTALA violation if the non-destination hospital provides a quick evaluation or treatment of the patient without following the EMTALA requirements.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text"><span class="All-Caps-Bold">Note:</span> CMS has issued two memoranda on the use of emergency transport personnel  on hospital property to hold and monitor an emergency patient pending the availability of services in the emergency department.

For several years, there has been a split in opinion between the federal circuit  courts of appeal as to whether EMTALA applies to inpatients, including the transfer and discharge of inpatients in an unstabilized condition. Prior to the 2003 EMTALA regulations,   the 1st and 6th Circuit Courts of Appeal applied EMTALA to inpatient discharges and  transfers. In contrast, the 4th and 9th Circuit Courts of Appeal declined to extend EMTALA to the treatment, transfer or discharge of inpatients. These cases are discussed in chapter 14, "Private Actions to Enforce EMTALA."</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In <span class="Italic">Roberts v. Galen of Virginia, Inc.</span>, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals applied EMTALA to the transfer of an inpatient in an allegedly unstabilized condition to a long-term care facility after   a two-month hospital stay. During oral argument on an appeal of the Courtâ€™s decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Solicitor General (on behalf of the federal government) advised    the Court that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services would adopt regulations clarifying whether EMTALA applied to inpatients.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In 2003, CMS addressed the "inpatient" issue by providing that the EMTALA obligations    are terminated when an individual is admitted in good faith for inpatient care in order to stabilize an emergency medical condition. The regulations adopt the definition of "inpatient" in the Medicare Hospital Manual: "a person who has been admitted to a hospital for bed occupancy for purposes of receiving inpatient hospital services." However, CMS warned  that EMTALA will apply if a hospital admits an emergency patient in bad faith (i.e., to avoid EMTALA requirements), and then inappropriately transfers or discharges the individual without meeting the stabilization requirement.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The EMTALA regulations apply to the interpretation and enforcement of EMTALA by CMS. They are not binding on the courts. In a 2009 decision, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals observed that the regulation excluding inpatients from EMTALA "is contrary to the plain language" of the EMTALA statute. In the case, the inpatient stay occurred prior to the 2003 change in the regulations, so the decision did not strike down the regulation. In 2012, a district court in Texas reached a similar conclusion. The decisions, <span class="Italic">Moses v. Providence Hospital and Medical Ctrs.</span> and <span class="Italic">Liles v. TH Healthcare, LTD, et al.</span>, are discussed in chapter 14.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In 2008, CMS amended the EMTALA regulations to clarify that the obligation to accept the transfer of an emergency patient does not apply to the transfer of an inpatient at another hospital. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> clarify that emergency patients who are placed in <a id="_idIndexMarker039"></a>observation status are not inpatients, even if they occupy a bed overnight in the observation unit. Therefore, the receiving hospital obligation applies to the transfer of an emergency patient in observation status.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In 2012, CMS confirmed, in commentary, that it was maintaining its current policy that EMTALA obligations end when an individual is admitted in good faith for inpatient care in order to stabilize an emergency medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">Inpatients continue to be subject to the standards and protections of the Medicare Conditions of Participation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-5"><span class="Reference-mark CharOverride-3">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-3">42 C.F.R.

Instead, CMS has stated that an appropriate MSE will vary according to the patientâ€™s presenting complaint, history and medical condition, as well as the capabilities of the hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In general, an EMTALA enforcement survey team is instructed to identify the scope of  MSEs and patterns of care of a hospital in evaluating compliance with EMTALA. The factors described below â€” non-discrimination, individual and condition-specific, continuous monitoring and contemporaneous documentation â€” will be considered in determining whether a MSE is appropriate.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>Non-<a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a>Discrimination</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> state that:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">The MSE must be the same MSE that the hospital would perform on any individual coming to the hospitalâ€™s dedicated emergency department with those signs and symptoms, regardless of the individualâ€™s ability to pay for medical care. If a hospital applies in a nondiscriminatory manner (i.e., a different level of care must not exist based on payment status, race, national origin, etc.) a screening process that is reasonably calculated to determine whether an EMC exists, it has met its obligations under EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The tests described in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> are generally consistent with the standards adopted by the federal courts for providing an appropriate medical screening. In <span class="Italic">Jackson v.

California law expressly requires that:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">In no event shall the provision of emergency services and care be based upon, or affected by, the personâ€™s ethnicity, citizenship, age, preexisting medical condition, insurance status, economic status, ability to pay for medical services, or any other characteristic listed or defined in subdivision (b) or (e) of Section 51 of the Civil Code, except to the extent that a circumstance such as age, sex, preexisting medical condition, or physical or mental disability is medically significant to the provision of appropriate medical care to the patient.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap3_rebuild.html#footnote-000" data-href="footnote-000">2</a></span></span> [Health and Safety Code Section 1317(b)]</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In performing EMTALA enforcement surveys, the surveyors are instructed to look for possible discrimination based on nonclinical factors as to the manner in which the hospital conducts MSEs. If discrimination based on nonmedical factors (i.e., patient financial status, race or other nonclinical factor) is detected, the surveyors are directed to report the information to  the Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>Individual and Condition-Specific</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The scope of an appropriate MSE must be tailored to the presenting signs and symptoms and the medical history of the individual. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> describe the screening examination as a process that may range from a simple examination (e.g., a brief focused history and examination) to a complex examination that may include laboratory tests, MRI or diagnostic imaging, lumbar punctures an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r other diagnostic tests and procedures. In some cases, the MSE may require a reasonable period of observation and monitoring, or consultation with an on-call specialist, to determine whether the individual has an EMC.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Continuous Monitoring</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> emphasize that a MSE is not an isolated event; it is an ongoing process. The medical record must reflect ongoing monitoring in accordance with the individualâ€™s needs, and must continue until the individual is stabilized or appropriately transferred or discharged.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> provide that the medical record should contain evidence of an evaluation prior to discharge or departure from the hospital for a transfer to another facility.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a>Documentation</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The determination of the appropriateness of the MSE is based on the documentation of the examination. In the Investigative Procedures for EMTALA Surveyors portion of the State Operations Manual, CMS has directed surveyors to determine whether the medical record contains, as appropriate, documentation of the screening, tests, mental status, impressions and diagnosis (supported by a history and physical examination, laboratory tests and other tests and procedures).</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The importance of documentation is critical to demonstrating that the hospital provided an appropriate MSE or other required treatment. In some cases, the charting is incomplete or is missing relevant data, test results and clinical findings. In unusual cases, the medical record should explain the sequence of events, rather than random notes throughout the record or no notes at all. Many hospitals have been cited for failure to provide an adequate MSE or required treatment because of inadequate documentation. Hospitals are therefore encouraged to review a sample of emergency patient medical records, and take corrective action as may be appropriate.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-6">42 C.F.R.

However, CMS also emphasized that all MSEs do not have to be "equally extensive."</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">CMS therefore added a subsection to the EMTALA regulations to address the hospitalâ€™s obligations to a non-emergent patient who presents to a dedicated emergency department seeking examination or treatment:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">If an individual comes to a hospitalâ€™s dedicated emergency department and a request is made on his or behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition, but the nature of the request makes it clear that the medical condition is not of an emergency nature, the hospital is required only to perform such screening as would be appropriate for any individual presenting in that manner to determine that the individual does not have an emergency medical condition [42 C.F.R. Section 489.24(c)].</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">As an example, CMS described a hypothetical case of an individual who presents to a dedicated emergency department seeking the removal of sutures. The analysis by CMS of  the hypothetical case noted that the patient visit implicated the EMTALA obligations since the individual came to a dedicated emergency department seeking examination and treatment  for a medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">CMS indicated that the hospital may have an emergency nurse, who has been designated  by the hospital and medical staff as a qualified professional to perform an MSE, conduct the MSE examination by obtaining the individualâ€™s history, examining the sutures and determining whether the wound is healing appropriately. If the nurse concludes that the patient does not have an EMC, CMS stated that the EMTALA obligations would be satisfied.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In the preamble to the final regulations, CMS noted, however, that if it is later found that the individual who requested the removal of sutures in fact had an EMC, the extent and quality of the MSE by the nurse would be subject to review to determine whether the MSE was adequate [68 Fed. Reg. 53237].</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Hospitals that propose to use registered nurses to perform the MSE should review the discussion under <a href="EMTALA_Chap3_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor015" data-href="_idTextAnchor015">H.&nbsp;"What are the requirements for certifying nurses and other health care professionals to perform medical screening examinations?" </a>, as well as Appendix M.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span><span class="CharOverride-1">	</span>Reference:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-6">42 C.F.R.

As applied to a pregnant woman having contractions, the EMTALA regulations define an "emergency medical condition" as a condition in which there is inadequate time to effect a safe transfer to another hospital before delivery, or when a transfer may pose a threat to the health and safety of the woman or the unborn child. The regulations define "stabilized" as the delivery of the child and placenta.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">If a woman is in labor, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> require that the hospital must deliver the infant or transfer the patient in an appropriate manner:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">She may not be transferred unless she, or a legally responsible person acting on her behalf, requests a transfer and a physician or other qualified medical personnel, in consultation with a physician, certifies that the benefits to the condition of the woman and/or the unborn child outweigh the risks associated with the transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The transfer of a woman in labor is case-specific, and a high priority for EMTALA  enforcement. Therefore, CMS will review the womanâ€™s prenatal history, her condition at the time of presentation to the hospital, the condition of the unborn child at the time of transfer or discharge, the respective capabilities of the transferring and receiving facilities, the expected delivery time and the means of transport.

Managed care plans provide coverage for emergency services, but often place limits on services or restrict payment for emergency services. These colliding imperatives have resulted in efforts by the federal and state governments to increase access to emergency services by patients covered by <a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a>managed care plans, place limits on the ability of health plans to require prior authorization or control the provision of emergency services, and sanction hospitals for treating managed care patients in any manner different from other emergency patients.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Under the EMTALA regulations, a hospital may not delay providing a medical screening examination (MSE) or other emergency services in order to inquire about an individualâ€™s method of payment or insurance status. In 1999, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) published a Special Advisory Bulletin (see Appendix H) to address the application of the EMTALA obligations to the provision of emergency services to managed care patients. In the 2003 revised EMTALA regulations, CMS adopted guidance set forth in the Special Advisory Bulletin prohibiting hospitals from seeking prior authorization for screening or stabilization services until the hospital has provided the MSE and initiated further examination and stabilizing treatment.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The primacy of EMTALA over managed care is emphasized in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-2">If an individual seeking care is a member of a managed care planâ€¦the hospital is obligated to comply with the requirements of [EMTALA] regardless of the individualâ€™s payor source or financial status. The hospitals [sic] is obligated to provide the services necessary to determine if an [emergency medical condition] is present and provide stabilizing treatment if indicated. This is true regardless if the individual is enrolled in a managed care plan that restricts the enrolleeâ€™s choice of health care provider. EMTALA is a requirement imposed  on hospitals, and the fact that an individual who comes to the hospital is enrolled in a managed care plan that does not contract with that hospital has no bearing on the obligation of the hospital to conduct an MSE and to at lease [sic] initiate stabilizing treatment. A managed health care plan may only state the services for which it will pay or decline payment, but that does not excuse the hospital from compliance with EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">In 2013, CMS issued a Survey and Certification letter (Appendix X) that reinforced the requirement for all Medicare-participating hospitals and critical access hospitals to comply with EMTALA, regardless of any conflicting requirements of third-party payors.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Some states have adopted laws providing for access to emergency services. For example, California law requires that emergency services must be provided without first questioning a patientâ€™s ability to pay. California has also adopted several laws related to managed care and emergency services, including post-stabilization services.</p></li>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor003"></a>Questions<ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"></a> When can a hospital request information on a patientâ€™s financial or insurance status?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The federal EMTALA and state laws on financial and insurance inquiries for emergency patients are not the same. The EMTALA regulations preclude delays in emergency services to make financial or insurance inquiries, and prohibit actions that discourage patients from remaining for further evaluation or treatment. California law is more restrictive, requiring that emergency services be provided without first questioning the patientâ€™s ability to pay. As discussed below, CMS has warned hospitals that aggressive financial registration practices, including collection of money before examination or treatment, may result in EMTALA sanctions.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>EMTALA Requirements</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">As noted above, the EMTALA regulations provide that a hospital may not delay providing a MSE or other emergency services in order to inquire about an individualâ€™s method of payment or insurance status. In 2003, CMS amended the regulations to clarify that a hospital may follow reasonable registration processes for patients covered by EMTALA. Patient registration may include requests for basic demographic information (such as name, address and other pertinent nonfinancial information). It may also include requests for insurance status and plan membership, as long as the inquiry does not delay the medical screening or treatment.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">CMS and the OIG historically have emphasized that inquiries or use of insurance or economic information that delay the provision of an MSE or necessary stabilizing treatment are  prohibited under EMTALA. As stated in the EMTALA regulations, "Reasonable registration processes may not unduly discourage individuals from remaining for further evaluation."</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In addition, the 1999 Special Advisory Bulletin recommends that, prior to performing the MSE or commencing stabilized treatment, a hospital should not ask a patient to complete financial responsibility or Advance Beneficiary Notice of Noncoverage (ABN) forms or ask patients for co-payments for services (see Appendix H).</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">As discussed below, the EMTALA regulations were amended in 2003 to incorporate prior CMS guidance that a hospital may not seek prior authorization before the MSE or commencement of stabilizing treatment for an emergency medical condition (EMC). Although a managed care plan may inform the hospital, physician or the patient that coverage will not be provided, the denial of coverage does not affect a hospitalâ€™s obligations under EMTALA to screen the patient and provide necessary stabilizing treatment for an EMC.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In May 2012, CMS notified the major hospital associations of its concern with respect to "aggressive debt collection activities" that may have occurred in some hospitals. The CMS letter cited a specific allegation that a hospital may have tried to collect money from emergency patients before they were examined or received necessary treatments. The letter also stated:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">We would have serious concerns with the legality of any hospital policy or procedure that may discourage individuals from seeking emergency care, such as demanding that emergency department patients pay before receiving treatment. Our priority must be to ensure that hospitals do not delay screening exams or stabilizing treatment for patients in order to inquire about an individualâ€™s method of payment or insurance status. (Letter dated May 9, 2012, from Marilyn Tavenner, Interim Administrator of CMS.)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In a subsequent EMTALA survey, CMS cited a hospital for failing to use a reasonable registration process. The survey report included an allegation that patients were asked to  pay copayments, co-insurance or past due amounts during the same time that they were still receiving medical screening and treatment services. The report also stated that patients were advised of the cost of care that had already been incurred prior to completion of services, which resulted in one patient declining a recommended overnight admission to the hospital  for further monitoring and observation of her condition. Several of the allegations were also  the subject of a separate survey under the Medicare Conditions of Participation for patient rights.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In December 2013, CMS issued Survey and Certification Memorandum 14-06: EMTALA Requirements &amp; Conflicting Payor Requirements or Collection Practices (Dec. 13, 2013) (Appendix X) in response to the hospital debt collection activities it was observing. The guidance reiterated that "[a] request to an individual to make immediate payment for services required under EMTALA while such required services are being provided does not fall under either of the permitted exceptions" to the general prohibition on inquiring about method of payment or insurance status. CMS also reinforced the idea that</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">"[a] request by the hospital for immediate payment by an individual who is protected under EMTALA goes well beyond a mere inquiry about payment method. Furthermore, a request for immediate payment risks creating the appearance that the hospital is linking provision of services required under EMTALA to the individualâ€™s ability to pay."</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a>State Requirements</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The California hospital licensing laws provide that emergency services and care must be provided without first questioning the patientâ€™s ability to pay. As described in chapter 1, "Overview of Patient-Dumping Laws," the term "emergency services and care" includes the MSE and necessary stabilizing treatment for patients who have an EMC.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-5">42 C.F.R.

Moreover, the OIG and [CMS] believe that in the absence of an initial screening, the decision of a managed care plan regarding the need for treatment is likely to be ill-informed.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">OIG has previously stated that it will seek civil money penalties in cases demonstrating a pattern of patients leaving the hospital after triage, but prior to the MSE if the hospital has requested prior authorization for emergency services. A representative of OIG has stated that the office will consider the routine seeking of prior authorization before screening as an aggravating circumstance, that is, a condition that may increase the cost of settlement or civil money penalties.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker005"></a>When can the emergency physician contact the patientâ€™s physician to discuss the patientâ€™s course of treatment?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In the Special Advisory Bulletin (Appendix H), CMS and OIG clarified the ability of the treating physician to call the patientâ€™s physician at any time for clinical reasons. This guidance was subsequently codified in the EMTALA regulations:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">An emergency physician or nonphysician practitioner is not precluded from contacting the individualâ€™s physician at any time to seek advice regarding the individualâ€™s medical history and needs that may be relevant to the medical treatment and screening of the patient, as long as this consultation does not inappropriately delay services required under paragraph (a) [medical screening] and paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) [stabilization, transfer or inpatient admission].</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">It should be noted that the broad language in the regulation suggests that the emergency physician should be able to contact any physician who can provide clinical information that will assist in providing emergency services to the patient.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In its 2013 guidance (Appendix X), CMS noted its concern with payors requiring a secondary evaluation and approval before an individual with an EMC is admitted as an inpatient or transferred to another facility, including payors directing that individuals are transferred to a specific facility. If the individualâ€™s condition is not stabilized, payor intervention in an admission or transfer decision could place the hospital at risk for an EMTALA violation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Hospitals should expect that CMS and OIG will closely scrutinize discussions with a patientâ€™s physician (especially a gatekeeper or other managed care physician) to determine whether they are clinical or financial in nature. If an off-site physician provides necessary clinical information and other assistance to the treating physician, those discussions will be viewed  as enhancing the quality or continuity of medical services, and therefore will not result in an EMTALA violation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">On the other hand, if the off-site physician attempts to limit or deny necessary emergency services for the patient or influence the treating physician to transfer or discharge the patient, CMS or OIG may later take the position that any subsequent action taken by the hospital or the treating physician to discharge the patient was tainted by the directions of  the off-site physician. As noted in footnote 4 of the Special Advisory Bulletin, if the managed care physician requests that the patient be transferred, the treating physician must provide medical screening and necessary stabilizing treatment, and if the patient is not stable, effectuate an appropriate transfer only if there is a medical necessity or an informed patient request for the transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">As discussed below, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> and the Medicare Advantage regulations provide that the judgment of the treating physician takes precedence over the judgment of an off-site physician or the patientâ€™s health plan.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip _idGenParaOverride-7"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> Hospitals should conduct in-service education for emergency physicians, nurses and other staff who may contact attending staff or managed care plans in the course of an emergency visit. The program should review the limitations on seeking prior authorization and the implications of relying on orders or directions from off-site physicians or health plan personnel for patient care or disposition. As appropriate, quality improvement reviews should include cases involving contacts with attending staff or managed care plans prior to the MSE or the commencement of stabilizing treatment.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-5">42 C.F.R.

This staff member also should be knowledgeable about the hospitalâ€™s anti-dumping statute obligations and should clearly inform the patient that, notwithstanding the patientâ€™s ability to pay, the hospital stands ready and willing to provide a medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment, if necessary. Hospital staff should encourage any patient who believes that he or she may have an emergency medical condition to remain for the medical screening examination and any necessary stabilizing treatment. Staff should also encourage the patient to defer further discussion of financial responsibility issues if possible, until <span class="CharOverride-3">after</span> the medical screening has been performed.

If the patient is not a member of a health plan that contracts with the hospital, the hospital should reaffirm (and document) its offer to provide a MSE, and it should take reasonable steps to encourage the patient to remain for the examination.

Although the Special Advisory Bulletin did not specifically address collection of co-payments prior to medical screening, it advised that a "best practice" was not to obtain an individualâ€™s agreement for payment before stabilization. This suggests that co-payments should not be solicited or collected from the patient before the MSE has been completed.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">If a patient offers a co-payment and insists that he or she does not want to defer its collection until after emergency services are rendered, then registration should note that the patient voluntarily offered the co-payment.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 ParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker006"></a>When should <a id="_idIndexMarker007"></a>Advance Beneficiary Notices be given to patients seeking emergency services?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-8">An Advance Beneficiary Notice of Noncoverage (ABN) is a Medicare-required written notice (CMS R-131) to a Medicare beneficiary that payment for services from a hospital or physician may be denied.

As explained by CMS in a prior posting on the Medicare Learning Network:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-9">The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has engaged physicians and their professional organizations in conversations surrounding the perceived conflict between EMTALA requirements and Advance Beneficiary Notice (ABN) instructions. Other than possible problems due to coding conventions â€¦ this problem seems to be more one of confusion than of real conflict. EMTALA  does not prohibit asking payment questions entirely, rather, only doing so before screening/stabilization. After screening/stabilization, EMTALA no longer applies and ABNs may be given. Under CMS policy, an ABN should not be given to any patient under great duress, which includes patients seeking emergency services before they are stabilized. Nothing in CMS policy prohibits giving ABNs, when otherwise appropriate, to patients who come to emergency care settings after they have received a medical screening examination and are stabilized.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"></a>What are the Knox-Keene requirements for emergency services?<span class="CharOverride-4"><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap4_rebuild.html#footnote-000">1</a></span></span><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idIndexMarker008"></a>In California, the Knox-Keene Act governs the licensing of managed care plans.

										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Under the Knox-Keene Act, a health plan or an independent practice association (IPA) may not require a hospital to obtain authorization prior to providing emergency services and care. Health plans and IPAs may require a hospital to obtain prior authorization for care provided after the patient is stabilized.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"></a>Prior Authorization for <a id="_idIndexMarker011"></a>Post-Stabilization Services</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">A health plan or IPA that requires prior authorization must provide 24-hour access for enrollees and providers to obtain timely authorization for medically necessary care to be provided to an enrollee who has received emergency services and is stabilized, but the treating provider believes the patient may not be transferred or discharged safely. If the prior authorization requirement involves a determination of whether the post-stabilization services are medically necessary, a request for authorization must be reviewed and processed in accordance with written criteria and guidelines that are supported by clinical principles and processes.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">A decision to approve or deny authorization must be made in a timely fashion, in light of the enrolleeâ€™s medical condition. For example, decisions must be made within five business days in all cases, or within 72 hours if the enrollee faces an imminent and serious threat to his or her health. Generally, a timely decision for a patient who is stable for transfer but requires an inpatient admission or transfer to a higher level of care for follow-up care should be shorter (perhaps hours), depending on the circumstances.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The plan must make a physician available for consultation and resolving disputed requests  for authorization. These requirements do not apply to a health plan that does not require prior   authorization as a prerequisite for payment of necessary medical care following stabilization  of an EMC. Existing regulations require the plan to respond to the providerâ€™s request for authorization to provide post-stabilization care within 30 minutes of the request. The failure of a health plan to meet this requirement is deemed to constitute authorization for the follow-up medical care to the patient.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"></a>Request for Post-Stabilization Services</p>

This discussion does not apply to emergency services provided to a patient who is still covered by the EMTALA obligations (i.e., the patient has an EMC that is not stabilized).</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Pursuant to revisions to the California hospital licensing laws effective Jan. 1, 2009, if a patient with an EMC who is a member of a health plan that requires prior authorization for post-stabilization services (i.e., medically necessary care provided after the patientâ€™s EMC is stabilized) presents to a noncontracting hospital, the hospital, with the exception of certain minor procedures described below, must do all of the following before initiating post- stablization services:</p>
										<ol>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-4">Seek to obtain the name and contact information of the health plan.

The person calling the health plan or a contracting medical provider is not required to be a physician;</li>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Upon a request of the health plan or its contracting medical provider, the hospital must provide the diagnosis and other relevant information reasonably necessary for the plan or medical provider to make a decision to authorize post-stabilization care or assume the management of the patientâ€™s care by arranging a prompt transfer to another hospital.</li>

The health plan or contracting medical provider, after conferring with  the noncontracting hospital, must transmit appropriate portions of the patient record (if in possession of the plan) by fax or electronic mail, as may be requested by the noncontracting hospital or treating physician and consistent with applicable laws protecting patient privacy.</p>

If the patient or hi<span class="No-break">s/h</span>er legal representative refuses to sign the notice, the hospital must document in the patient record that the notice was provided and the refusal to sign.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"></a>Independent Medical Review</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">An enrollee may request the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) to provide an independent medical review of a health planâ€™s or IPAâ€™s denial of a claim for urgent or emergency services based in whole or in part on the lack of medical necessity.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As a condition of seeking the review, the enrollee must first give the health plan 30 days to resolve the grievance, or three days to do so if the services have not yet been provided and the enrollee faces an imminent and serious threat to his or her health (such as severe pain, potential loss of life, limb or major bodily function). Hospitals and other providers are not authorized to initiate the independent medical review process, but they may join with or assist the enrollee in pursuing medical review and may act as the enrolleeâ€™s advocate.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"></a>Strategies for Obtaining Authorization and Payment</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Although there are no surefire methods to ensure that hospitals and physicians receive authorization an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r payment in a timely manner for rendering post-stabilization care, the following measures are suggested.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Reinforce Member Responsibility</span></p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Hospitals should review their admission practices and forms to ensure that they obtain an appropriate acknowledgment and agreement of financial responsibility for each patient. If the hospital does not contract with the patientâ€™s health plan, the acknowledgment should include the patientâ€™s agreement to accept financial liability for the hospital charges that the health plan or IPA refuses to pay. If the hospital contracts with the patientâ€™s health plan, the plan contract will address the circumstances in which the patient is responsible for the hospitalâ€™s charges. In most cases, the patient should acknowledge that he or she will pay for services that the health plan or IPA refuses to authorize, but which the patient requests be provided, as well as emergency services if the health plan or IPA later determines that the enrollee did not have an EMC.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Pursue Member Responsibility</span></p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The Knox-Keene Act contains more provisions protecting enrollees than provisions protecting providers. The DMHC does not have the power to resolve disputes between providers and plans (e.g., to order a health plan to pay a particular claim). However, the DMHC has the power to review and resolve grievances made by enrollees.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Moreover, if the grievance pertains to a denial based on medical necessity, the DMHC has the final authority to resolve the grievance. In consideration of hospital billing and collection practices, noncontracting hospitals may in some instances be able to pursue a health plan enrollee under his or her acknowledgment of financial responsibility in order to encourage the enrollee to submit a grievance to the health plan an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r the DMHC. Once a grievance is initiated, the hospital may participate in the grievance review an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r independent medical review process.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Make Timely Requests for </span><span class="Bold"><a id="_idIndexMarker015"></a></span><span class="Bold">Prior Authorization</span></p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Hospitals should review their internal procedures for determining the need for prior authorization, and then seek any necessary authorization at the appropriate time during the patientâ€™s course of treatment. If a patient presents to the hospital with an EMC, emergency services and care may be provided without authorization; however, authorization should be obtained before proceeding with post- stabilization care. If a patient is determined by the MSE not to have an EMC, then authorization should be obtained prior to proceeding to provide follow-up care for the patient (unless the patientâ€™s condition destabilizes before authorization is obtained).</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Patient is Unstable for Transfer</span></p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If a receiving hospital is requested to accept the transfer of an emergency health plan patient who has an EMC that is not stabilized and needs a higher level of care, the hospital should accept the patient if it has the capacity and capability to provide the services. The hospital should confirm the patientâ€™s unstable condition with the transferring hospital or physician, and make sure that it obtains a copy of the physicianâ€™s certification for the transfer. Following the admission of the patient at the receiving hospital, the hospital should seek authorization for services that will be required for the patient after he or she is stabilized. If the health plan or IPA fails or refuses to give an authorization for post- stabilization services, the hospital should request that the plan assume responsibility for the patientâ€™s continuing post-stabilization care (which may involve a further transfer to a plan-contracting hospital). As long as the patient is unstable, the hospital should continue to provide stabilizing treatment for the patient, and should not transfer the patient except as the result of an informed request by the patient, medical necessity or other valid clinical reasons.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Patientâ€™s Condition is Stabilized for Transfer</span></p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If a receiving hospital is requested to accept the transfer of a health plan patient whose EMC is stabilized, but the patient needs post-stabilization services at a facility providing a higher level of care, the receiving hospital is not obligated to accept the transfer unless it has a legal or contractual obligation to do so (see chapter 7, "Obligations of Receiving Hospitals"). The hospital should confirm with the transferring hospital or physician that the patientâ€™s EMC is stabilized. The hospital may then advise the transferring hospital that is willing to admit and treat the patient, subject to obtaining prior authorization for the post-stabilization services.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Consistent with its EMTALA obligations, the receiving hospital should inform the transferring hospital that, if the patientâ€™s condition destabilizes while it is seeking prior authorization, the transferring hospital should immediately call the receiving hospital to arrange for the transfer without waiting for the authorization to be received. Assuming that the patientâ€™s condition remains stabilized and authorization is obtained, the hospital may accept the transfer and provide the authorized services to the patient. If the patient later requires services that exceed the scope of the authorization, the hospital should follow the process discussed above for obtaining further authorization or request that the health plan or IPA assume responsibility for providing the additional treatment required for the patient.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Require Health Plans and IPAs to Assume Responsibility</span></p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As discussed above, if a health plan or IPA does not grant authorization for post-stabilization services within a reasonable period of time, the hospital should request (or if necessary, demand) that the health plan or IPA assume responsibility for the enrolleeâ€™s plan (such as arranging for a transfer if medically appropriate).</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Pursue Dispute Resolution Opportunities</span></p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">To the extent feasible and prudent, a hospital should submit inappropriate denials to the health planâ€™s dispute resolution process.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Pursue Contract Remedies</span></p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Hospitals that contract with a health plan that has denied authorization or payment should review its contract with the plan to determine its contractual remedies that are in addition to its legal remedies.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Report Unfair Payment Patterns to DMHC</span></p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Health plans are prohibited from engaging in "unfair payment patterns." If a hospital believes that a health plan is engaged in a "demonstrable and unjust patternâ€¦ofâ€¦denying complete and accurate claims" within a reasonable time, the hospital may report the unfair payment pattern to the DMHC Office of Plan and Provider Relations. The Office may be contacted at 877-525-1295 or providers@dmhc.ca.gov. Although the DMHC cannot order payment to a provider, it can impose administrative sanctions on the health plan.</p>

										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The regulations prohibit plans from limiting access to emergency services. A plan cannot include instructions to seek prior authorization for emergency or urgently needed services in materials furnished to enrollees (including wallet cards).

If the hospital does not have the capability to provide necessary stabilizing treatment, or upon an informed request by the patient, the hospital must make an appropriate transfer of the patient to another facility. In addition, if a hospital has exhausted its capability or is operating beyond its capacity, an appropriate transfer must be made if the EMC is not stabilized.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">An emergency patient who has an unstabilized EMC may be transferred only if one of two conditions is present:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">The patient makes an informed request for the transfer; or</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker000"></a>The transfer is for medical reasons and the transferring physician certifies that  the medical benefits reasonably expected from treatment at the receiving facility outweigh the increased risks to the patient from the transfer.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">An appropriate transfer of a patient with an <a id="_idIndexMarker001"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker002"></a>unstabilized EMC must meet four basic criteria:</p><ol>

This portion of the manual (II. "Stabilization of Emergency Medical Conditions") addresses the concept of "stabilization" as applied to EMTALA patients.  If a patient has an EMC that has not been "stabilized," a hospital may not transfer the patient unless either there is an informed patient request or a physician certification for the transfer, and the transfer is implemented in accordance with EMTALA standards that are addressed in <a href="EMTALA_Chap5_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor011" data-href="_idTextAnchor011">III.&nbsp;"Standards for Appropriate Transfer," </a>.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>When is an emergency medical condition considered to be "stabilized?" <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The term "stabilized" is one of the most important and most misunderstood words in the EMTALA statute and regulations. An understanding of the meaning of "stabilized" is critical since it determines:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">When a hospital has met its EMTALA obligations to a patient who has an EMC;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">When a hospital must follow the EMTALA standards for making an appropriate transfer of a patient; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">When a receiving hospital must accept, or may refuse to accept, a transfer of a patient with an EMC from another hospital.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Under the EMTALA regulations, <span class="Bold">"stabilized"</span> means, with respect to an EMC, that no    material deterioration of the patientâ€™s condition is likely, with reasonable medical probability, to result from or occur during the transfer or discharge of the patient from the facility, or that a woman has delivered her child and the placenta. The same definition is also used in California law.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Unfortunately, physicians often use the terms "stabilized" and "stable" interchangeably, which may not always be correct. This sometimes results in confusion on the part of staff at the transferring and receiving facilities regarding when a patient has an EMC that is "stabilized" within the meaning of EMTALA.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a>If a patient is determined to be "stable," does that mean that the EMC is stabilized?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">As used by EMTALA, the term "stabilized" has a meaning that differs from the common   use by physicians of the term "stable." In the St. Anthony Hospital decision <span class="Italic">(see chapter 7, "Obligations of Receiving Hospitals")</span>, the court noted that the legal definition of "stabilization" in EMTALA is different from the medical use of the term "stable" to denote the status of a patient or hi<span class="No-break">s/h</span>er condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The concern regarding the use of the medical term "stable" is illustrated in a 2013 Survey and Certification Letter issued by CMS (Appendix X). In the letter, CMS cautioned hospitals that  "the statutory definition of an individualâ€™s EMC being â€˜stabilizedâ€™ does not necessarily equate   to an individual being clinically stable."</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-6">The similarity of the terms "clinically stable" and "stabilized" appears to cause confusion among hospitals, practitioners and other hospital staff. It is not uncommon for practitioners to find that an individual has become "clinically stable," often understood to mean the normalization of the individualâ€™s vital signs, and then conclude that the hospitalâ€™s EMTALA obligation has ended. However, if the EMC has not been stabilized, as that term is defined â€¦ [by   the EMTALA regulations], EMTALA continues to apply. For example, a patient diagnosed with appendicitis might have relatively normal vital signs, but is still  in need of surgery, and therefore continues to have an EMC that has not been stabilized.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-6">Furthermore, many practitioners and some third-party payors seem to assume that if an individual can withstand the risk of a transfer, then that means the individual has been stabilized and the hospitalâ€™s EMTALA obligation has ended. This also is not necessarily the case. This mistaken assumption can be reflected in the commonly used term "stable for transfer." "Stable for transfer"  is not a term used in EMTALA, and it is not necessarily equivalent to the term "stabilized," as defined for EMTALA purposes. Use of this term can, therefore, be very misleading.

The revisions to the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> stated that a patientâ€™s EMC is deemed stabilized if the treating physician (or other qualified professional) determines within reasonable clinical confidence that the patientâ€™s EMC has been "resolved."</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The term "resolved" does not appear in the EMTALA statute or regulations, and is not defined by CMS in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>. As part of clarifying the meaning of "resolved," CMS stated that patient stabilization does not require the resolution of the underlying medical condition. As an example, CMS describes a patient with an asthma attack who requires treatment under EMTALA to alleviate the acute respiratory symptoms. After the immediate EMC is resolved, the hospital may discharge the patient, admit the patient or transfer the patient depending on his or her needs (noting that the transfer is not covered by EMTALA because the EMC was resolved). CMS notes that this guidance is a clarification, rather than a change, of policy.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> warn that if there is a dispute between CMS (or a surveyor) as to whether an individualâ€™s EMC is stabilized (or resolved), the burden of proof is the responsibility of the transferring hospital. Surveyors are directed to assess patient stability and refer appropriate cases to the quality improvement organization (QIO) for review.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Despite the effort to develop a clearer meaning of the term "stabilized" or the implications of the term "resolved," the best guidance offered by CMS is as follows:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-6">If the treating physician is in doubt that an individualâ€™s EMC is stabilized the physician should implement an appropriate transfer â€¦ to prevent a potential violation of EMTALA, if his/her hospital cannot provide further stabilizing treatment.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-7">42 C.F.R.

Since CMS has not adopted separate standards for psychiatric EMCs, the definition of "stabilized" for medical emergencies (i.e., no material deterioration of the condition is likely,  with reasonable medical probability, to result from or occur during the transfer or discharge of  a patient from a facility) also applies to whether a psychiatric EMC is stabilized.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">It is important to keep in mind that there is no distinction under the EMTALA rules between the transfer of an individual with a medical EMC or an individual with a psychiatric EMC. In 2016, OIG settled with Research Medical Center (RMC) of Missouri for $360,000 to resolve RMCâ€™s:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Failure to provide an adequate MSE and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Making an improper transfer of a patient with a psychiatric EMC.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The patient arrived at RMCâ€™s ED and, without providing stabilizing treatment, RMC transported the patient to a nearby facility by private vehicle. During transport, the patient exited the vehicle and was struck by another vehicle. In the course of its investigation, OIG found 17 additional occasions where RMC failed to provide adequate MSEs and improperly transferred or discharged patients with psychiatric EMCs, without providing stabilizing treatment.

Therefore, in the event of a disagreement between the treating physician and an off-site physician, the medical judgment of the treating physician will usually take precedence over that of the off-site physician. As noted in chapter 4, "Financial Considerations â€” EMTALA and Managed Care," the Medicare Advantage regulations state that the treating physician must decide when the enrollee is considered stabilized for transfer or discharge, and that his or her decision is binding on the plan.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-7"><span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, tag nos.

The circumstances and conditions under which an EMTALA transfer could be made to a CSU are discussed in chapter 6.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The response to the second question, transfer from ED to ED, is within the discretion of the receiving hospital. While a transferring physician may request admission of a patient to a specific bed unit or department, the receiving hospital may route the patient through its ED or other bed unit or department based on clinical considerations.

If the receiving hospital has established a transfer center or a central number for processing requests for transfers, the sending hospital should call the transfer center or other centralized unit for handling transfers.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Do not call the receiving hospital emergency department and ask for the name and telephone number of an on-call physician before you have talked with staff  at the receiving hospital. Under EMTALA, transfers are hospital-to-hospital, and the receiving hospital should be able to assess its bed and service capacity and capability before contacting an on-call physician. Calling the on-call physician before talking with the hospital may delay the transfer. In addition, the accepting physician may not be aware of the receiving hospitalâ€™s capacity, which could result in a patient arriving for stabilizing services that are not available.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker013"></a>Have pertinent portions of the medical record available to provide orally,  electronically or in hard copy to the receiving hospital. If the receiving hospital requests portions of the medical record in order to evaluate whether it can meet the needs of a patient with an unstabilized EMC, give or send only clinical information (not financial information). If the time necessary to fax or transmit the record may jeopardize the condition of the patient, advise the receiving hospital that the delay    to send the records may result in further deterioration of the patientâ€™s condition.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">If the patientâ€™s EMC is not stabilized (i.e., an EMTALA transfer), do not discuss the patientâ€™s financial status or insurance information with the receiving hospital or physician.

The use of personal vehicles to transfer a patient whose condition is not stabilized or resolved is not expressly prohibited under EMTALA; however, it is clearly disfavored and CMS will closely scrutinize  the reasons why personal transportation was used. The use of personal transportation for a patient whose EMC is not stabilized or resolved does not absolve the hospital from meeting the standards for an appropriate transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">If the emergency physician approves or recommends the use of a personal vehicle for the transfer, the physician should document his or her reasons in the medical record.

In general, EMTALA focuses on the capability and capacity of the hospital as   a whole, rather than the capability of the dedicated emergency department. For example, if a hospital provides obstetric services, the staff and resources of the obstetric service must be considered available to screen and treat a woman in labor who comes to the hospital.</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"></a>Capability to Provide Services<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">EMTALA compliance is more difficult if a hospital does not have an organized service or medical specialty to treat the needs of a particular emergency patient. CMS will determine on a case-by-case basis whether a hospital has the capability to provide a service even if the hospital is not licensed to offer that service. For example, in the preamble to the 1994 EMTALA regulations, CMS stated that a hospital that does not offer perinatal services may not transfer a woman having contractions if the hospital has the staff and facilities to perform an uncomplicated delivery. In a 2017 settlement, the OIG determined that a South Carolina hospital that maintained a "voluntary" psychiatric unit allegedly violated EMTALA by not providing psychiatric examination and treatment in the ED, and maintained "involuntary" psychiatric patients in the ED for "days and weeks" instead of admitting the patients to its voluntary psychiatric unit for stabilizing treatment. Further details of this case are discussed in chapter 6 of this manual.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"></a>Capacity to Provide Services<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The EMTALA regulations define <span class="Bold">"capacity"</span> as the ability to admit or treat patients (e.g., staff, beds and equipment) as well as the "hospitalâ€™s past practices of accommodating additional patients in excess of its occupancy limits." As noted in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, if "a   hospital has customarily accommodated patients in excess of its occupancy limits â€¦ it has,   in fact, demonstrated the ability to provide services to patients in excess of its occupancy limits." CMS will look at the hospitalâ€™s history of absorbing emergency patients by shifting patient room assignments or calling in additional staff. If a hospital has provided services to emergency patients in excess of its service capacity, CMS may allege an EMTALA violation if the hospital denies treatment to a similar patient with an EMC.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"></a>Capacity and Nurse Staffing Ratios<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idIndexMarker019"></a>The nurse staffing standards in California place a hospital in a Catch-22 situation when it has available beds but does not meet the staffing ratios at the time of an emergency admission. Does a hospital have "capacity" within the meaning of EMTALA to admit a critically ill  individual with an unresolved EMC if the admitting unit will not meet the staffing ratios; or, should (or must) the patient be transferred?</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In 2004, the Licensing and Certification Division of CDPH issued guidance in responding to "health care emergencies," which it defined as temporary overcrowding and saturation due  to a rapid influx of patients. In a Jan. 9, 2004 memorandum to hospitals (AFL 04-01), CDPH stated the following:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-6">Hospitals are <span class="Bold">not required to seek prior approval from [CDPH], L&amp;C   to decrease staffing levels below required ratios during a healthcare emergency</span>. Hospitals are expected to respond immediately to emergency situations in the most effective manner to ensure the health and safety of their patients. They will not be found in violation of the nurse-to-patient ratio regulations during a healthcare emergency, provided they can demonstrate they took appropriate steps to try to maintain required staffing levels. (emphasis in original)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">CDPH has also noted that observation beds in a licensed emergency department are not counted in a hospitalâ€™s licensed bed capacity. According to CDPH, "hospitals are expected   to meet their obligations under state and federal laws to provide emergency services without regard to any requests to increase patient accommodations."</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">CDPH has not issued additional advice on how it would interpret and enforce the staffing ratios with respect to an individual emergency admission or transfer when there is no saturation or overcrowding. In the absence of guidance, the hospital must decide whether to admit the patient (and possibly violate the nurse staffing ratios) or make an appropriate transfer of the patient to another hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">If the hospital admits the patient when it is out of compliance with staffing ratios, a surveyor may later cite the hospital under state law, which may subject the facility to fines or other sanctions under state and federal laws, as well as litigation by the patient if there is an adverse outcome. If the hospital transfers the patient, a surveyor may later review the admission patterns at the time of the transfer (were other patients admitted or transferred?) and the historical practices of the hospital in admitting or transferring patients in similar situations. The survey could result in an EMTALA violation, as well as potential litigation if there is an adverse outcome.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">CDPH has noted that hospital self-reporting for non-compliance with the staffing ratios is intended to apply only to "all occurrences that disrupt the operation of the facility," including health care emergencies that result in a failure to meet the staffing ratios despite planning   for census fluctuations. Therefore, hospitals are not required to self-report all events that CDPH could cite as a violation. Self-reporting for an emergency admission (in the absence of a health care emergency) of a potential violation of the staffing ratios requires an evaluation    of the needs of the patient and other facts relating to the circumstances. Hospitals are encouraged to discuss this subject with their legal counsel.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"></a>Reserved Critical Care Beds<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Under CMSâ€™s interpretation of "capacity," a reserved intensive care unit (ICU) bed may be considered "available" for admission of a patient with an EMC, even if a nonemergency   surgery scheduled for another patient who will require an ICU bed must be delayed or cancelled. However, if an ICU bed is reserved for a patient who is already in surgery and there are no other open ICU beds, the hospital will be at its capacity. Hospitals should review their policies for reserved critical care beds for guidance on admission or transfer of an emergency patient.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"></a>Requirement to Transfer<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> require that when "a hospital has exhausted all of its capabilities in attempting to remove the EMC, it must effect an appropriate transfer of the individual."

These laws have also been raised in other counties in California, but the enforcement actions in Los Angeles have received extensive publicity, including attention in a motion picture and by the national media.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-12">The media, the Los Angeles City Attorney, and various homeless advocates have focused considerable attention on the problem of an appropriate destination for discharged homeless patients. Concerns have been expressed that some hospitals may send discharged homeless patients to skid row areas of town so that those patients may stay in a shelter while further recuperating from their illness or injury. Some shelters have expressed the view that they are not staffed or equipped to handle a convalescing patient, especially a patient who requires follow-up care.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-12">This media and law enforcement attention has resulted in legislative and judicial efforts to change the procedures by which homeless patients are discharged from hospitals and to penalize hospitals for discharge decisions an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r for facilitating the transport of homeless patients to shelters or other destinations that cannot meet the needs of the patients.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"></a>Federal Laws on Emergency Patient Discharge<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">As discussed above, the EMTALA <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> require that emergency patients who are discharged must receive a plan for appropriate follow-up, including information necessary to prevent a relapse or worsening of their medical conditions.

These arrangements include care at a skilled nursing or intermediate care facility, hospice or at home.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Section 1262.5 clearly applies whether a patient is or is not homeless, although unlike   Section 1262.4, it does not impose specific standards for homeless patients.<span class="CharOverride-3"><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap5_rebuild.html#footnote-000" data-href="footnote-000">5</a></span></span> CDPH has not issued a formal interpretation as to whether the discharge planning requirements of Section 1262.5 apply to emergency patients (as well as other outpatients). The authorâ€™s view is that,   in the absence of CDPH guidance or a judicial interpretation of the statute, Section 1262.5 applies only to the discharge of inpatients, and conversely, does not apply to emergency patients. This view is based on the wording of the statute and the legislative history, which indicate an intent to codify in state law the Medicare Condition of Participation for discharge planning (which, as noted above, do not apply to emergency patients).</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"></a>Litigation (City of Los Angeles)<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Beginning in December 2005, the Los Angeles City Attorney initiated enforcement efforts related to the transport of homeless patients to skid row. The initial effort involved a letter to several hospitals alerting them of possible legal action for their discharge practices involving homeless patients.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Since November 2006, the City Attorney has filed criminal and civil charges against several hospitals within and outside the City of Los Angeles for the practice of "homeless dumping." The complaints generally allege that the hospitals discharged and transported to skid row homeless patients without a plan for post-hospital care or verifying that a place could    provide adequate shelter and recuperative care services. The complaints have included both criminal counts (such as false imprisonment and dependent adult endangerment), and civil complaints (such as unlawful and unfair business practices, including failure to follow state  law on discharge planning).</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In the complaints, the City Attorney has described "homeless dumping" as including the following elements:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Discharging homeless patients without proper clothing, sometimes no more than a hospital gown;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Discharging homeless patients on a gurney or wheelchair, with intravenous or other equipment attached to the patient;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Discharging homeless patients prematurely;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Arranging for homeless patients to be transported considerable distances, often up to 15 to 30 miles, notwithstanding the availability of a closer shelter; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Transporting homeless patients to skid row without first checking to determine the availability of shelter beds or services necessary for the patients.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Since May 2007, the City Attorney has entered into several settlement agreements with hospitals that require the hospitals to develop a training program for hospital staff and a discharge protocol for all homeless patients (including emergency patients). The discharge protocol must be monitored by a third party who must approve the training program, review quarterly certifications of compliance and recommend contempt actions for violations of the settlement agreement. The settlement agreements also include funding of homeless services, fines and other costs.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Under the common form of the discharge protocol, the hospitals agree to the following practices for all homeless patients:</p><ol>
										<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-3">Record homeless patients on a homeless patient log.</li>
										<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Provide appropriate clothing at the time of discharge.</li>
										<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Assess patient "cognitive intactness," including living conditions and support systems; complexity of the discharge plan; orientation to person, time and place; ability to provide self-care; and access to medical care, food and shelter.</li>
										<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Perform a needs assessment, including food and shelter, treatment for substance abuse or domestic violence, vocational assistance, Medicaid enrollment and eligibility for other public services.</li>
										<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Establish discharge plans that meet patient medical and social needs, with appropriate referrals and help with eligibility for Kaiserâ€™s Financial Assistance Program to obtain drugs or equipment.</li>
										<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">For a post-discharge referral to a shelter, the hospital must locate available options, assure that the patient meets the shelterâ€™s criteria for acceptance and document the consent of the patient and shelter to the placement.</li>
										<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">For a patient seeking transport to a skid row shelter, the hospital administrator (or designee) must approve the discharge plan.</li>
									</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The hospitals also agreed to implement an in-service program for physician, clinical, social service, discharge planning and other staff involved in the care and discharge of homeless patients. The training program included the requirements of the discharge protocol; homelessness in Los Angeles County; problems faced by homeless patients; assessment of cognitive intactness; post-discharge issues; communication with homeless patients; location of shelters and services for the homeless; referral sources; the hazards of skid row; and the use of surrogate decision makers for homeless patients.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In 2008, the authority of the Los Angeles City Attorney was reinforced by the enactment of an ordinance by the Los Angeles City Council applying to the transportation by all health facilities of discharged patients. While the ordinance is directed to homeless patients, it applies to transporting all patients to a location other than their own residence or other another facility. Under the ordinance:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style">A health facility may not transport or cause a patient to be transported to a location other than the patientâ€™s residence without written consent, except when the patient is transferred to another health facility following bona fide procedures in accordance with another provision of law.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">For purposes of the ordinance:</p><ol>
										<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-3">A <span class="Bold">"patientâ€™s residence"</span> is defined as the home of the patient, the fixed and regular nighttime residence or domicile of the patient, or in the case of a patient who is reasonably perceived to be homeless, the location that the patient gives as his/her principal place of dwelling.</li>
										<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List"><span class="Bold">"Written consent"</span> is defined as knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily given written consent that is signed by the patient or his/her legal representative.</li>
									</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The ordinance does not apply to patients who are in the care and custody of state hospitals or correctional facilities or law enforcement.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Although the ordinance was adopted by the City of Los Angeles and clearly applies to  hospitals located within city limits, the City Attorney has interpreted the ordinance as applying to any hospital located outside of the city limits that transports a patient to any location (and especially skid row) within the City of Los Angeles in violation of the terms of the ordinance.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The City Attorney is continuing to initiate enforcement efforts in this area and to ensure that hospitals are proactively implementing guidelines regarding evaluation and discharge planning of homeless patients.</p><hr class="HorizontalRule-1"><div class="_idFootnotes">

However, in response to comments on the adoption of the 1994 EMTALA regulations, CMS inserted "psychiatric disturbances" in parentheses within the definition of "emergency medical condition." <span class="Italic">(See Appendix B.)</span> As a general rule, CMS applies EMTALA equally to psychiatric emergencies and non-psychiatric emergencies.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Compliance with EMTALA for psychiatric emergencies has proven to be a challenge for hospitals. Many facilities do not provide psychiatric services, and donâ€™t have psychiatrists or other mental health professionals on staff who are available to evaluate or treat patients with psychiatric crises. Psychiatric emergency patients may also pose treatment and other challenges, such as security concerns and elopement, that differ from patients seeking treatment for non-psychiatric emergency medical conditions (EMCs). However, the biggest challenge to hospitals has been managing psychiatric patients for hours or days while seeking the placement and transfer of psychiatric patients to specialty facilities.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The EMTALA obligations also collide with state laws permitting detention of individuals for involuntary psychiatric evaluation and treatment, alignment of patients with local networks of designated facilities, and a sometimes bewildering array of county policies and guidance for detention and placement that vary from county to county and, in some instances, may conflict with EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Neither the EMTALA regulations nor the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> address involuntary holds. More than a decade ago, an EMTALA Technical Advisory Group (TAG) identified the conflict of the EMTALA requirements with state laws for involuntary detention and local networks for crisis services. In response, CMS declined to change the EMTALA regulations or the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> to address the conflicts, other than confirming that transferring psychiatric patients under community protocols could violate EMTALA in some cases.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (LPS) enacted Californiaâ€™s mental health involuntary detention laws in 1967. Under LPS, counties have the responsibility, with state approval, to designate facilities (designated facilities) that are authorized to detain, evaluate and treat involuntary psychiatric patients. State law authorizes law enforcement personnel to detain an individual in order to obtain evaluation and treatment of a mental health disorder. In addition, each county has the discretion to designate health professionals (designated professionals) who may write an involuntary hold. The pre-admission process for detention and treatment under LPS is summarized in <a href="EMTALA_Chap6_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor003" data-href="_idTextAnchor003">II.&nbsp;"LPS â€” Summary of California Mental Health Involuntary Detention Laws," </a>.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Statewide oversight of LPS is assigned to the California <a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a>Department of Health Care Services (DHCS). However, the implementation and administration of LPS is primarily a county function. Many counties have adopted their own interpretations of LPS, some of which vary from the interpretations adopted by other counties. The interpretations related to transfers are discussed in <a href="EMTALA_Chap6_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor025" data-href="_idTextAnchor025">VI.&nbsp;"EMTALA Obligations for Placement and Transfer of a Patient With a Psychiatric EMC," </a> and other interpretations are discussed in <a href="EMTALA_Chap6_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor034" data-href="_idTextAnchor034">VIII.&nbsp;"Common Questions and Issues Related to the Intersection of EMTALA and LPS in Non-Designated Hospitals," </a>.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The complexities of applying EMTALA to psychiatric patients and facilities, and the intersection of EMTALA and state mental health laws, treatment networks and county rules, have resulted in substantial risks to hospitals for EMTALA violations. CMS Region IX has reported that issues regarding psychiatric patients and facilities have high visibility on the CMS radar screen for potential EMTALA violations. The list of psychiatric emergency issues reported by Region IX covers the range of the EMTALA obligations:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">The scope of triage and medical screening of psychiatric patients in all emergency departments (EDs), especially EDs in non-designated hospitals;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Requirements for monitoring, further evaluation and treatment of psychiatric patients in all EDs;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Elopement of psychiatric patients from EDs;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Compliance with the rules for making appropriate transfers of psychiatric patients to accepting hospitals;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Compliance by receiving hospitals with the EMTALA rules for accepting psychiatric patient transfers without regard to the patientâ€™s insurance or financial status, or the transfer of patients across county or state lines;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Whether psychiatric hospitals operate dedicated emergency departments; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Whether psychiatric hospitals comply with the Medicare Conditions of Participation for providing emergency services if they do not operate dedicated emergency departments.</li></ol></li>

LPS also establishes certain rights and procedural protections for persons who are held for involuntary evaluation or treatment.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As noted in the overview, oversight of LPS is assigned to DHCS, which assumed this responsibility in 2012 following the dissolution of the California Department of Mental Health.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">LPS assigns significant responsibilities to counties, including the designation of facilities and professionals who are authorized to evaluate and treat involuntary patients. In the absence of guidance from the state, many counties have adopted their own interpretations of LPS and the application of LPS to involuntary patients, designated facilities and professionals. Therefore, each hospital should consult with its own legal counsel and its county department of behavioral health regarding the interpretations of LPS by the county.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Although amended in 2013, the LPS pre-admission process has remained largely static for the past 50 years. However, psychiatric services and the legal landscape have fundamentally changed.</p><ol>

											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">While a designated facility cannot refuse entry to a peace officer who has custody of an involuntary patient, many psychiatric facilities require that an acute hospital "medically clear" an involuntary psychiatric patient before accepting a transfer of the patient for evaluation and treatment.</li>

The 5150 hold permits involuntary detention for up to 72 hours in order to provide assessment, evaluation and crisis intervention or placement of the person for evaluation and treatment at a designated facility.

If the professional concludes that the patient can be adequately served without being detained, the person must be provided evaluation, crisis intervention, or other inpatient or outpatient services on a voluntary basis.</li>

It has therefore been generally believed that psychiatric services and facilities that admit only voluntary patients, and are not designated facilities, are not required under EMTALA to admit or accept transfers of involuntary patients.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In a June 2017 settlement, the OIG, following a CMS Region IV EMTALA investigation, determined that a South Carolina acute care hospital that maintained a "voluntary" psychiatric unit allegedly violated EMTALA by not providing psychiatric examination and treatment in the ED for emergency psychiatric patients, and maintained "involuntary" psychiatric patients in the ED and did not admit them to its voluntary psychiatric unit. The OIG reported that there were 36 incidents of individuals with psychiatric EMCs. These patients were reportedly not evaluated by on-call psychiatrists, and were involuntarily committed and kept in the ED for 6 to 38 days, despite available beds in its voluntary unit. The patients were described as ranging in age from young adults to elderly adults, and with suicidal or homicidal conditions. The hospital settled the investigation with the OIG for $1,295,000.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The hospital reportedly had limited admissions to voluntary patients for over 30 years under hospital-approved policies. The conclusions by CMS and the OIG as the hospitalâ€™s capability to admit the patients appear to be contrary to the CMS guidance quoted above as to hospitals determining their own capability and not being required to expand their services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">It is difficult to evaluate whether the investigation and settlement of this case is an anomaly, or whether the investigation by CMS and the OIG reflects a change in policy or interpretation of EMTALA. In California, involuntary patients must be admitted to a designated facility for evaluation and treatment. It is unclear if CMS or the OIG would apply the same interpretation so as to require acceptance by a voluntary facility of a transfer of an involuntary patient with a psychiatric EMC, or admissions or transfers conflicting with other facility or service limitations such as age.</p></li></ol></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"></a>EMTALA Requirements for Patients Presenting With Psychiatric Conditions<ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"></a>The Medical Screening Examination for a <a id="_idIndexMarker022"></a>Psychiatric Emergency Patient<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">If a patient presents to the ED of an acute hospital seeking or in need of examination of a psychiatric condition, whether as a voluntary or involuntary patient, the hospital must record the patientâ€™s visit in the central log, open a medical record and provide a medical screening examination (MSE) within the capability of the hospital to determine whether the patient has an EMC.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The MSE must include both medical and psychiatric assessments, including tests as may be clinically indicated, which must be performed or ordered by a physician or another qualified professional designated by the hospital and medical staff for performing screening examinations and working under hospital policies.

											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">A 5150 hold is based on probable cause by a peace officer or designated professional (who may or may not be a physician) to detain a person for psychiatric evaluation and treatment. The determination of probable cause, especially by a peace officer, does not, and is not intended to include the elements of an MSE or the professional judgment of an ED physician.</li>

However, the existence of a 5150 hold is not the sole or determining factor as to whether a person has a psychiatric EMC. The judgment of the treating ED physician, as documented in the medical record, is the basis for determining the presence or absence of a psychiatric EMC and whether the condition is stabilized. Regardless of the presence of a 5150 hold, the treating physicianâ€™s judgment should override the significance of the 5150 hold if the physician, based on his or her examination of the patient, determines that the patient does not have a psychiatric EMC or that the EMC is stabilized.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> The lack of clarity from CMS on the relationship of 5150 holds and EMTALA places non-designated hospitals at risk of an EMTALA violation with respect to the treatment and discharge of patients on a 5150 hold, and whether the patients are transferred in accordance with EMTALA standards. As a result, hospitals should continue to evaluate and monitor the status of the individual during his/her stay in the ED, including times that the individual is in the custody of a designated professional or in observation status. Hospitals should also consider The Joint Commission standards for boarding psychiatric patients awaiting placement at designated facilities (see reference below). Until CMS provides more definitive guidance on psychiatric transfers, it is recommended that transfers of psychiatric emergency patients on a 5150 hold comply with EMTALA standards described in Chapter 5.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References"><span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, tag no.

Consistent with EMCs of a non-psychiatric nature, the view of CMS appears to be that a psychiatric EMC is considered stabilized when it is determined that no material deterioration of the condition is likely, within reasonable medical probability, to result during the transfer or discharge of the patient from the facility.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">There is a bit of guidance from <a id="_idIndexMarker031"></a>CMS on the stabilization of psychiatric conditions. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> note that the administration of chemical or physical restraints during transfer may "stabilize" a psychiatric patient for a period of time and temporarily resolve the underlying EMC, but that the condition may be exacerbated if the condition is not treated. Therefore, CMS recommends that providers "should use great care when determining if the medical condition is in fact stable after administering chemical or physical restraints."</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">If a patientâ€™s psychiatric EMC is resolved, the patient may be discharged, especially if the patient is not subject to a 5150 hold. As with a medical patient, the hospital must provide the patient with discharge instructions, including a plan for follow-up care.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Under California law, a patientâ€™s psychiatric EMC is considered to be stabilized if, in the opinion of the treating physician or other qualified professional, the patientâ€™s psychiatric EMC has reached the point where, within reasonable medical probability, no material deterioration of the patientâ€™s psychiatric EMC is likely to result from, or occur during, the transfer of the patient. The California law essentially follows the EMTALA test for establishing when an EMC is stabilized. In addition, California law requires providers to provide a written aftercare plan for mental health patients.

In one case, a hospital was cited for failing to comply with EMTALA when a patient released from a 5150 was ready for discharge late in the evening. In this instance, the patient lived a considerable distance from the hospital (e.g., over 25 miles) and refused to seek transportation assistance from a family member or a friend. The hospital was subsequently cited by CMS because it "â€¦ did not fully implement the stabilizing measures  as determined by the mental health crisis worker â€¦ The stabilizing measures identified by â€¦ [the crisis worker] â€¦ were located in Patient 1â€™s home town and Patient 1 was discharged without a means to get to her homeâ€¦"</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-9">42 C.F.R.

Hospitals located in those States which have State/local laws that particular individuals, such as psychiatric or indigent individuals, are to be evaluated and treated at designated facilities/hospitals may violate EMTALA if the hospital disregards the EMTALA requirements and does not conduct an MSE and provide stabilizing treatment or conduct an appropriate transfer prior to referring the individual to the State/local facility ... Hospitals are also prohibited from discharging individuals who have not been screened or who have an emergency medical condition to non-hospital facilities for purposes of compliance with State law. The existence of a State law is not a defense to an EMTALA violation for failure to provide an MSE or failure to stabilize an EMC therefore [sic] hospitals must meet federal requirements or risk violating EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In a different section of the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, CMS advises that patient health status frequently depends on the appropriate use of community plans (such as trauma and psychiatric hospitals).

The rationale of the memorandum should apply equally to counties, especially as each county operates the local Medi-Cal mental health plan, and may attempt to direct or limit facility placement.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The memorandum addresses stabilization of EMCs and transfers:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">As to stabilization of an EMC, the memorandum warns that some payors may assume that a person who is "clinically stable" for transfer is no longer covered by EMTALA. This may be applicable to psychiatric patients who are medically clear, but are still perceived by the treating physician as having a psychiatric EMC. Per CMS, if an ED patient has an EMC, including a psychiatric EMC, that is not been stabilized as determined by the treating physician, the patient is still covered by EMTALA:<p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-11">"Stable for transfer" is not a term used in EMTALA, and it is not necessarily equivalent to the term "stabilized," as defined for EMTALA purposes â€¦ although the individual may be "stable for transfer," he/she nevertheless has an unstabilized EMC, and remains protected under EMTALA before, during and after the transfer.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">As to transfers, the memorandum warns hospitals as to potential third-party interference in transfers of EMTALA patients:<p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-11">Anecdotally we have become aware of some third-party payors with policies or proposed policies that seem to assume, incorrectly, that any individual for whom a transfer is being planned has been "stabilized," and thus is no longer protected under EMTALA.

The transferring hospital may arrange an appropriate transfer of an individual with an unstabilized psychiatric EMC to any facility that has the capacity and capability to stabilize the individualâ€™s psychiatric EMC. The transfer of an ED patient with an unstabilized psychiatric condition may be arranged with any facility within or outside of the county in which the sending hospital is located, as well as across state lines, if necessary, in order to find a facility that has the capacity and capability to stabilize the emergency psychiatric condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	Reference:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References">CMS Survey and Certification Memorandum 14-06, EMTALA Requirements &amp; Conflicting Payor Requirements or Collection Practices (Dec. 13, 2013)</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 ParaOverride-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"></a>Are there different standards for accepting the transfer of a patient with a psychiatric EMC?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-10">As discussed in this chapter, CMS makes no distinction under the EMTALA rules between the transfer of an individual with a medical EMC and an individual with a psychiatric EMC.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-10">As the flip side of the previous question, a receiving hospital cannot refuse an appropriate transfer of an individual with a psychiatric EMC, if it has the capacity and capability to stabilize the individualâ€™s EMC.

However, the EMTALA statute and regulations, in describing the standards for an appropriate transfer, do not refer to the receiving provider as a "hospital." Rather, the statute and regulations refer to the receiving provider more broadly as a "medical facility." The use of the term "facility" rather than "hospital" suggests that EMTALA permits a hospital to transfer an EMTALA patient, i.e., an individual with an unstabilized EMC, to a facility that is not a hospital so long as the receiving facility has the capability and capacity to stabilize the EMC. As pertinent to psychiatric emergency patients, the reference to a "medical facility" could be interpreted to permit hospitals to transfer an EMTALA patient to a PHF or a CSU even if they are not considered to be "hospitals."</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In November 2009, CMS Baltimore headquarters, in a letter to the author of this manual, indicated that there are circumstances in which a hospital could transfer an EMTALA patient to a CSU. The CMS letter (Appendix V) cautions that each case must be reviewed based on the following:</p><ol>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The specific facts of the case;</li>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The clinical condition of the patient;</li>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The certification for transfer by the transferring physician and other pertinent information; and</li>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Whether the CSU has the capacity and capability to stabilize the EMC.</li>
										</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Based on the CMS letter, the sending physician, in addition to meeting all of the requirements for an appropriate transfer, must determine that the CSU has the capacity and capability to stabilize the EMC of each specific patient. The CMS letter recommends that hospitals seeking to transfer EMTALA patients to a CSU should develop transfer policies to assess the capabilities of the CSU to stabilize an EMC.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The number of CSUs in California has continued to grow in the past few years, and more CSUs will be opening as a result of state grant funds to expand the number of CSUs. Most CSUs are not licensed by the state or under the jurisdiction of CDPH; rather, they operate under certification by DHCS and LPS designation by the counties.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">While the 2009 CMS letter indicates that a CSU may be a resource for placement of psychiatric patients, recent surveys of transfers to CSUs by some hospitals have drawn skepticism from some CDPH surveyors. Some surveyors have expressed concern whether the transfer of a patient with a psychiatric EMC should be made to an ambulatory facility that is limited to keeping the patient less than 24 hours. In two cases, statements of deficiencies have been issued by CMS to hospitals for transferring a psychiatric patient to a CSU. In one instance, the patient was subsequently transferred back to the sending hospital. In the second case, the patient was subsequently transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility for an inpatient admission.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">A CSU may be able to provide psychiatric evaluation and crisis services, which is a higher level of care than some EDs. However, the statement of deficiency reflects a view that a receiving CSU must be able to stabilize the psychiatric EMC. It cannot be an interim stop between the ED and an inpatient psychiatric admission.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The following are recommendations for CSU transfers:</p><ol>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-3">Develop a transfer agreement with the CSU that sets forth the criteria of the CSU for accepting emergency psychiatric patients and other information that will facilitate the decision-making process by the treating physician.</li>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Expect that a surveyor will query the sending hospital and treating physician as to their knowledge of the admitting criteria and the service limitations of a CSU.</li>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Work closely with the CSU to identify the types of patients whose psychiatric EMCs may be stabilized by a transfer to it within the 24-hour limitation, and conversely, the signs and symptoms, or manifestations of behavior, for persons who should not be considered for the CSU placement.</li>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Be selective in identifying patients for a CSU transfer and discuss the case in sufficient detail with the CSU to verify the appropriateness of the placement.</li>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">If a CSU transfer is implemented, document the reasons for transferring a patient with a psychiatric EMC to a CSU, including the expectation that the psychiatric EMC can be stabilized at the CSU.</li>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Conduct periodic QAPI reviews of CSU transfers in collaboration with the CSU, and use the findings for improvements in patient selection and the CSU transfer process.</li>
										</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">While the CMS letter permits, in selective circumstances, the transfer of an individual with a psychiatric EMC to a CSU, it must be remembered that a CSU is not a hospital. Therefore, the CSU has no obligation to accept the transfer of an EMTALA patient regardless of its capability and capacity.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	Reference:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References">Letter dated Nov. 12, 2009 from Marilyn Dahl, Director of Acute Care Services, Center for Medicaid and State Operation<span class="No-break">s/S</span>urvey and Certification Group, to Steve Lipton (Appendix V)</p></li></ol></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"></a>Post-EMTALA Issues: Patients With Psychiatric EMCs Who are Stabilized<ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"></a>Authorization for <a id="_idIndexMarker034"></a>Medi-Cal Patient Post-Stabilization Services<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The rules for obtaining prior authorization for post-stabilization services rendered to members of a Knox-Keene health plan are addressed in chapter 4, "Financial Considerations â€” EMTALA and Managed Care."</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">For psychiatric patients covered by a Medi-Cal health plan (MCP) or a Medi-Cal mental health plan (MHP), hospitals should be familiar with the rules for coverage of post-stabilization services that are obtained within, or outside, the plan network.

The author states that hospitals have been denied payment for claims by health plans in cases where the hospital treated a mental health emergency with an inpatient admission. The author states that there have been instances where a health plan automatically denies a claim for a psychiatric inpatient admission based on the fact that the patient did not have prior authorization. The author points out that health plans are already obligated to pay for the care and treatment necessary to alleviate the emergency, which in the case of a psychiatric emergency may include an inpatient psychiatric admission. The author argues that this bill will prohibit health plans from denying payment for appropriate treatment of a psychiatric medical emergency.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Under Section 1317.4a, the emergency services and care required to relieve or eliminate a psychiatric EMC is defined to include a possible admission or transfer to a psychiatric unit of a general acute care hospital or an acute psychiatric hospital. It is noted that the statute does not include transfers to a PHF or a CSU, each of which may be an appropriate facility for the transfer of an emergency psychiatric patient.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If the patient is on a 5150 hold, a transfer cannot be made in a manner that conflicts with the requirements of the involuntary detention and treatment rules of LPS that are described in this chapter.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Section 1317.4a permits a hospital to transfer a psychiatric emergency patient to another hospital in accordance with the procedures described below.</p><ol>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Section 1317.4a applies only if, "in the opinion of the treating provider, the patientâ€™s psychiatric emergency condition has reached the point that, within reasonable medical probability, no material deterioration of the patientâ€™s psychiatric emergency condition is likely to result from, or occur during, the transfer of the patient."<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Indent-1 _idGenParaOverride-4"><span class="Bold">Comment:</span> The language quoted above is virtually identical to the definition of "stabilized" under the EMTALA statute and regulations. As a result, it appears that transfers under Section 1317.4a of emergency patients with psychiatric EMCs are limited to patients who have been determined to have stabilized psychiatric EMCs. This appears to be confirmed by another subsection of Section 1317.4a that does not require authorization for emergency services if doing so is not required by law.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Indent-1 _idGenParaOverride-4">Therefore, a literal reading of Section 1317.4a is that the procedures described in Section 1317.4a do not necessarily apply to the transfer of a patient with a psychiatric EMC that is not stabilized in the judgment of the treating physician.</p></li>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">If the hospital proposes a transfer of a health plan enrollee with a stabilized psychiatric EMC, the hospital must do both of the following:<ol><li class="Body-Styles_Alpha-list _idGenParaOverride-13">The hospital must document in the medical record its attempt to obtain the name and contact information of the patientâ€™s health plan. The attempt to obtain this information includes:<ul><li class="Body-Styles_Bullet-List _idGenParaOverride-12">Requesting the patientâ€™s health plan member card;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Bullet-List _idGenParaOverride-12">Asking the patient, a family member or representative if he or she can identify the health plan; or</li><li class="Body-Styles_Bullet-List _idGenParaOverride-12">Using other means known to the hospital to identify the patientâ€™s health plan.</li></ul></li><li class="Body-Styles_Alpha-list _idGenParaOverride-13">If the hospital obtains the patientâ€™s health plan information, it must notify the health plan or the planâ€™s contracting medical provider of the transfer.

											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The notification to the health plan or the contracting medical provider must be made by:<ol><li class="Body-Styles_Alpha-list _idGenParaOverride-13">Following the instructions on the patientâ€™s health plan member card; or</li><li class="Body-Styles_Alpha-list _idGenParaOverride-13">Using contact information provided to the hospital by the health plan.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Indent-1 _idGenParaOverride-4">Health plans are required to provide this information to all non-contracting hospitals to which its members may be transferred, and update the contact information as necessary, but at least annually.</p></li>

											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">If the receiving hospital accepts and admits the patient, the receiving hospital must notify the health plan of the transfer.

For example, the LPS pre- admission process contemplates a direct handoff from a peace officer to personnel at a designated facility. In addition, Section 5150.1 prohibits a designated facility from refusing to accept the custody of the person from a peace officer if the facility does not have available beds. Similarly, Section 5150.2 prohibits a designated facility from detaining a peace officer longer than the time necessary to complete the documentation of the detention. Further, Section 5150(c) states that the assessment by a designated professional of a person detained by a peace officer shall not be interpreted to require the peace officer to perform any additional duties other than specified in Sections 5150.1 and 5150.2.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">In addition, a literal reading of Section 5150(a), as amended in 2013, suggests that a person who is involuntarily detained must be diverted either for psychiatric assessment, evaluation and crisis intervention, or placed in a designated facility for evaluation and treatment. Nothing in Section 5150(a) implies a third option or a gap in the process under which the detained individual may be taken to location (such as an ED of a non-designated hospital) that does not provide psychiatric evaluation and crisis intervention, or to a non-designated facility for psychiatric evaluation and treatment.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The diversion of individuals on a 5150 hold to non-designated hospitals is neither addressed nor contemplated in LPS. In the absence of any guidance from DHCS, counties have filled the vacuum with an array of conflicting viewpoints on the interpretation of LPS and strategies for engaging or not engaging with non-designated hospitals.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The most common questions are addressed below:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">When does the 5150 hold clock start?</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">What is the custodial status of a person on a 5150 hold if the peace officer or designated professional leaves the person in a non-designated hospital?</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Can a 5150 hold be released by an ED physician and other staff personnel if they are not designated professionals?</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">If the 5150 clock starts at the time of the hold, and a patient is not transferred within 72 hours, can a new 5150 hold be applied to the person?</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">If the patient is admitted for acute inpatient medical care, does the 5150 hold continue in place?</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The questions above do not include another frequent question, which is whether counties can restrict or direct transfers of non-designated hospital ED patients to specific facilities. That question is addressed above.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The reason these questions continue to arise is that there are no definitive answers, either in LPS, or in judicial decisions or Attorney General opinions. The discussion of these questions below is therefore intended to explain the issues and provide what little guidance there is available in an effort to assist non-designated hospitals in managing involuntary patients.</p><ol>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"></a>When does the 72-hour clock begin?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">This should be an easy question to answer since the 72-hour period has been in LPS for 50 years. Alas, there is not a clear answer that is universally accepted by all stakeholders in the LPS process.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The short answer is that there is a difference of opinion between counties, patient and disability rights advocates and other stakeholders as to the start of the 72-hour clock. As noted above, the reason for the disparity of views on this topic is that the 72-hour standard is mentioned twice in the preadmission sections of LPS: first, in Section 5150(a) related to the initial detention of a person, and second, in Section 5151 related to the admission of a person by a designated facility.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The alternate views on the question may be best explained by an FAQ on the website of the North Coast Emergency Medical Services Agency that serves the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt and Lake:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-8">The law has two conflicting statements as to when the clock starts â€“ one statement is found at WIC 5150 and the other (conflicting) statement is found at WIC 5151. Reasonable minds differ on this topic and until it is resolved by the legislature or a court, no one particular view is "correct." Lawmakers anticipated that little or no time would elapse between the writing of the 5150 and admittance into the designated Psychiatric Health Facility, designated Acute Psychiatric Hospital, or inpatient psychiatric unit in a General Acute Care Hospital. In the real world of today, individuals may wait 24-36 hours just to get admitted into a psychiatric facility. It may be interpreted that the 5150 clock starts when the 5150 document is written or at the time of admittance to the psychiatric facility.<span class="CharOverride-3"><span id="footnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap6_rebuild.html#footnote-001" data-href="footnote-001">6</a></span></span></p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In general, a majority of counties start the 72-hour clock under Section 5150 at the time that a person is first taken into custody or the time written on the application for the 5150 hold.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">However, several counties (such as the Counties of Los Angeles and San Bernardino, and the two counties mentioned in the North EMSA FAQ) consider that the 72-hour clock starts under Section 5151 when a person is involuntarily detained in a designated facility.<span class="CharOverride-3"><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap6_rebuild.html#footnote-000" data-href="footnote-000">7</a></span></span> These counties appear to start the 72-hour clock based on the two options under Section 5150 that follow the initial detention of a person:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The 72-hour clock starts at the time of involuntary detention if the person is provided assessment, evaluation and crisis intervention,</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">But if the person is placed in a designated facility for evaluation and treatment, the 72-hour clock starts at the time of arrival, or assessment or admission of the person at the designated facility.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In addition to the differing views of the counties, disability rights and some patient advocates take a more restrictive view that the 72-hour clock starts at the time of the initial detention, regardless of the course taken by the peace officer or designated professional under the options above or the diversion of the person to a non-designated hospital ED.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Until the law is changed, or there is a judicial decision or Attorney General opinion, the conflicting statements by the counties about the start of the 72-hour clock are likely to remain unresolved. Each hospital should consult its own legal counsel or county department of behavioral health to verify the start-of-the-clock interpretation in the county of the hospital. Hospitals are also advised to ascertain the clock-start interpretations in adjacent counties to which 5150 patients may be transferred.</p></li>
										<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"></a>What is the custodial status of a person on a 5150 hold if the peace officer or designated professional leaves the person in a non-designated hospital?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">While LPS applies to persons who are involuntarily detained, its provisions for evaluation and treatment apply only to services provided in designated facilities and by designated professionals. As noted above, the LPS pre-admission process does not contemplate an intervening transit of a detained person to the ED of a non-designated hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">There is no guidance in the law as to whether the involuntary detention of a person continues if the person having custody of the individual leaves the person in a non-designated hospital without another peace officer or designated professional assuming the custody of the person. In many counties, emergency physicians or other licensed personnel practicing in a non-designated facility are not designated professionals and are not authorized to write, enforce or release a 5150 hold.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">Some counties have offered guidance on this question. In November 2016, Orange County Behavioral Health Services advised all hospitals in the county of its view that a 5150 hold on a person who is in a non-designated hospital may remain in place only so long as a designated professional (or presumably a peace officer) retains custody of the person in the hospital. The designated professional may transfer custody of the person to another designated professional who is also in the facility. Subsequent to the letter, Orange County revised its LPS designation policies to expand the categories of personnel who may be designated professionals, which includes designated professionals practicing in a non-designated hospital. As discussed below, Orange County also indicated that an ED physician could consider a Health and Safety Code Section 1799.111 hold for up to 24 hours after the 5150 lapses.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-5"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	Reference:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-7"><a href="https://media.ocgov.com/gov/health/bhs/mhi/id.asp" target="_system">https://media.ocgov.co<span class="No-break">m/g</span>o<span class="No-break">v/h</span>ealt<span class="No-break">h/b</span>h<span class="No-break">s/m</span>h<span class="No-break">i/i</span>d.asp</a></p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">However, Orange County may be the exception. For example, Los Angeles County has stated in an FAQ that it has no authority to require personnel in a non-designated facility to continue the detention of a person under a 5150 if the detaining authority has left the facility; it recommends that hospitals consult their own legal counsel. Los Angeles County does not generally designate emergency physicians practicing in non-designated hospitals to write 5150 holds.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-5"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	Reference:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-7"><a href="http://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/dmh/189959_LPSFAQs2015-Sep2815.pdf" target="_system">http://file.lacounty.go<span class="No-break">v/S</span>DSInte<span class="No-break">r/d</span>m<span class="No-break">h/1</span>89959_LPSFAQs2015-Sep2815.pdf</a></p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">Since there is little definitive guidance on the continuation or enforcement of a 5150 hold by a non-designated professional in a non-designated facility if a peace officer or designated professional is not present, each hospital should consult its county department of behavioral health to determine if the county has a view on this issue. Hospitals should also consult their own legal counsel as to the potential legal risks of continuing and enforcing a 5150 hold by a non-designated professional when a custodial officer or professional has left the patient in the ED.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"></a>Can a 5150 hold be released by an ED physician and or other staff if they are not county-designated professionals?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">LPS contemplates that a person on a 5150 hold can be released by a designated professional following assessment, evaluation and crisis intervention services, or by a member of the attending staff of a designated facility at the time of the pre-admission assessment under Section 5151. In some counties, designated professionals have been authorized to re-evaluate 5150 patients in non-designated hospital EDs, and release the hold if they determine that there is no longer probable cause to detain the person involuntarily. As discussed in <a href="EMTALA_Chap6_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor023" data-href="_idTextAnchor023">V.&nbsp;"Stabilization of an Individual With a Psychiatric Emc for Purposes of Transfer," </a>, the decision by a designated professional to release a hold does not alter the hospitalâ€™s obligation to comply with the EMTALA obligations for further evaluation and treatment if the patientâ€™s psychiatric condition has not been stabilized.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">As discussed in the preceding question, there is uncertainty about whether a 5150 hold remains in effect if the person is transported to an ED of a non-designated hospital without the continuing presence of a peace officer or designated professional. If the ED physician or other staff professional working in or available to the ED is not a designated professional, there is no guidance in LPS and from most counties as whether the ED physician, if not a designated professional, can enforce the hold if the patient wants to leave the hospital. Conversely, there is no guidance in LPS and from most counties as whether the ED physician, if not a designated professional, can release the hold if he or she determines that there is no longer probable cause to maintain an involuntary hold on the person.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the absence of a change to LPS, or a court decision or other definitive legal guidance, each hospital should consult its county department of behavioral health to determine if the county has a view on the lapse of a 5150 due to absence of a peace officer or a designated professional, or by an ED physician if he or she determines there is no longer probable  cause to detain the person. Hospitals should also consult their own legal counsel about the potential legal risks to the hospital and a non-designated physician or other professional who attempts to release a 5150 hold, or deems the hold lapsed, in the absence of a peace officer or designated professional retaining custody of the person.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"></a>If the 72-hour clock starts at the time of the 5150 hold, and the hold is not released, or the patient is not discharged or transferred to a designated facility within 72 hours, can a new 5150 hold be applied to the person?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">This question addresses the concept of the serial hold. This is another topic for which there is no law or definitive guidance, and there are arguments on both sides of the issue. The issue typically arises when a person on a 5150 hold is held in a non-designated hospital for more than 3 days awaiting placement and transfer to a designated facility.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In some counties where ED patients in non-designated hospitals cannot be placed within 72 hours, a designated professional may be authorized by the county to conduct a new probable cause determination as to whether the person, as a result of a mental health disorder, is still a danger to self or others, or gravely disabled. If there is probable cause, the designated professional may be authorized by the county write a new application for the hold.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">However, patient advocates may take a more limited view. For example, a brochure published by Disability Rights California advises that at the end of the 72 hours, a person who is detained under Section 5150 must be released, have accepted evaluation or treatment on a voluntary basis, or been certified for intensive treatment on an involuntary basis.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">Each hospital is advised to consult its legal counsel if ED patients in a non-designated hospital are awaiting placement and transfer to designated facilities for more than 72 hours, and may be placed on serial 5150 holds. However, even if the 5150 hold must be released as a matter of law, the release of the hold does not alter the hospitalâ€™s EMTALA obligation to continue further evaluation and stabilizing treatment so long as the treating physician determines that the psychiatric EMC is not stabilized.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"></a>If an ED patient on a 5150 hold is admitted for acute inpatient medical (non-psychiatric) care, does the 5150 hold continue in place during the inpatient stay?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">There is no definitive guidance or legal authority as to the status of a 5150 hold if a detained person presenting to an ED is admitted to an acute bed for inpatient medical (non-psychiatric) care.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">However, most counties and commentators appear to adopt the view that the intervening event of an inpatient acute medical stay may impliedly break the involuntary hold. This appears to be based on a break in the LPS process, since placement and transport to a designated facility must be postponed until after the medical need for an acute inpatient stay is resolved. At the time of discharge, the hospital may need to seek a new probable cause evaluation for a 5150 if the discharge plan is to transfer the person to a designated facility for further evaluation and treatment for his or her psychiatric condition.</p></li></ol></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"></a>Health &amp; Safety Code Section 1799.111 â€” The 24-Hour Hold<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker036"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker037"></a>Separate and very apart from LPS, the Legislature has provided non-designated hospitals an alternative mechanism to applying or arranging for a hold for a psychiatric patient who meets probable cause for involuntary detention.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">In 1996, the Legislature enacted Health &amp; Safety Code Section 1799.111.

However, the immunities only apply if all conditions in the statute are met.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The statute is divided into two basic parts â€” subdivisions (a) and (b) establish the conditions that permit the involuntary detention of a patient in a non-designated facility, and subdivision (c) establishes the conditions under which the detention may be released while the patient is still in the non-designated hospital.

											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-3">The 1799.111 hold is limited to 24 hours, which may not be sufficient for a person whose psychiatric condition is more acute and for whom placement at a designated facility may take longer than 24 hours.</li>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">There is no legal authority to continue detention under Section 1799.111 after the expiration of the 24-hour period, or to re-start the detention process with a new evaluation and hold for a second 24-hour period.</li>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">It is uncertain whether a county-designated professional will come to the hospital to write a 5150 hold that begins upon or after the expiration of the 24-hour detention period.</li>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">If the placement of the person is arranged with a designated facility, some hospitals report that ambulance companies may be reluctant to transport the person without a subsequent 5150 hold to ensure involuntary detention of the person during the transfer.</li>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">In the absence of a judicial interpretation of Section 1799.111, there is some uncertainty as to the application and breadth of the immunity that is provided by the statute.</li>
										</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">At least one county has indicated that it may be appropriate to detain a person under Section 1799.111 after a person has been held under a 5150 hold. In its November 2016 letter to county facilities, the Orange County Behavioral Health Services expressed the view that a 5150 written by a peace officer or a designated professional automatically lapses in a non- designated hospital if the officer or professional leaves the hospital.

												<p class="Body-Styles_Footnote-Style ParaOverride-10">Over the past two decades, the number of acute psychiatric inpatient beds has decreased 30% throughout California. Twenty-five of Californiaâ€™s 58 counties have no adult inpatient psychiatric beds. Based upon population, California has one psychiatric bed for every 5,651 residents; nationwide, the average number of acute care psychiatric beds is one for every 4,887 people. Californiaâ€™s community mental health system has not been able to compensate for the loss of these beds. Many people with severe mental illnesses are too ill to be treated in a voluntary community setting and the vast majority of community mental health services are not geared to those individualsâ€™ clinical needs. Also, treatment needs have become more complicated with an increased number of those with severe mental illnesses having co-occurring medical conditions such as addictions or chronic physical health conditions coupled with a mental illness.</p>

The receiving hospital obligation applies to all hospitals participating in Medicare, regardless of whether they provide emergency services. The EMTALA statute captions the accepting hospital obligation with the term "nondiscrimination," implying that receiving hospitals do not have the discretion to refuse a transfer request for an emergency patient with an unstabilized EMC except in specific circumstances <span class="Italic">(see </span><a href="EMTALA_Chap7_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor007" data-href="_idTextAnchor007"><span class="Italic">D.&nbsp;"When can a hospital refuse to accept a transfer?" </span></a><span class="Italic">)</span>.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">CMS has suggested that any Medicare participating hospital may be considered to have specialized capabilities or facilities if it has the capability and capacity to provide a service that the transferring hospital does not have the capability to perform. Under this view of EMTALA, virtually every hospital must consider itself a receiving hospital and accept appropriate transfers of emergency patients with unstabilized EMCs from other hospitals that do not have the capacity or capability to provide stabilizing treatment. The expansive nature of the accepting hospital obligation was reaffirmed by CMS in 2006 when it amended the EMTALA regulations to clarify that any hospital with specialized capabilities must accept an appropriate transfer, even if the hospital does not operate a dedicated emergency department.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Enforcement of EMTALA by CMS and by patients in litigation cases against receiving hospitals that refuse the acceptance of an appropriate transfer has become very common. In the <span class="Italic">St. Anthony Hospital</span> case <span class="Italic">(see </span><a href="EMTALA_Chap7_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor005" data-href="_idTextAnchor005"><span class="Italic"></span></a><span class="Italic">)</span>, a federal appeals court upheld the imposition of OIG sanctions against a hospital for failure to accept an emergency patient with an unstabilized EMC. A growing number of hospitals have been cited for refusal to accept a transfer (including some cases involving individuals whose EMCs were arguably stabilized prior to transfer). Therefore, hospitals need effective policies, periodic in-service training and effective oversight of personnel and physicians who respond to requests to accept emergency patient transfers.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="All-Caps-Bold">Note:</span> This chapter is limited to legal obligations with respect to accepting patient transfers under EMTALA. Hospitals should consider ethical, philosophical and industry standards, as well as managed care obligations and transfer agreements with other hospitals, in making decisions on transfers, whether or not implicated by EMTALA or other laws.</p></li>

The request may be made to any hospital that may be able to provide treatment necessary to stabilize the EMC. Specifically, there is no requirement that the transferring hospital must contact the closest available hospital or a facility that is aligned with the patientâ€™s insurance or economic status, such as a county hospital; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">The receiving hospital has the specialized services (i.e., the higher level of care) required by the individual, and the capacity and the capability to provide those services.</li></ol></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>What are the lessons of the <span class="CharOverride-3">St. Anthony Hospital</span> case with respect to accepting patient transfers?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In <span class="Italic">St. Anthony Hospital v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 309 F.3d 680 (10th Cir. 2002), the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals reviewed an appeal by an Oklahoma hospital of an U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administrative decision to impose civil money penalties for the hospitalâ€™s refusal to accept an appropriate transfer of an emergency patient. The lessons from the case are instructive as to the views of the courts with respect to the receiving hospital obligation and the handling of requests to accept patient transfers.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2"> </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In the case, the patient was a 65-year old victim of an automobile accident who suffered a neurological injury. Although the transferring hospital arranged for a transfer to a university medical center, the ambulance returned to the transferring facility due to the patientâ€™s deterioration. Upon re-examination, the emergency physician determined that the patient had an injury to his abdominal aorta, and required immediate surgery that could not be performed at the hospital. The physician contacted an air-ambulance service, but could not transfer the patient to the university medical center since it had two pending emergency surgeries. The physician then contacted the emergency physician at another hospital, who referred the call to the on-call thoracic and vascular surgeon. The on-call surgeon declined to accept the case, and the transferring hospital finally located a third hospital that accepted the patient.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Following CMS review, the OIG proposed to impose monetary sanctions for the refusal by the second hospital to accept the transfer. When the parties failed to settle the case, the OIG initiated an administrative proceeding. The administrative law judge (ALJ) confirmed the EMTALA violation and imposed a $25,000 sanction. On appeal, the Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) affirmed the ALJâ€™s decision, and, on a cross-appeal by the OIG, increased the sanction to $35,000.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The defendant hospital then petitioned the 10th Circuit Court of Appeal to overturn the decision of DAB, citing numerous procedural and substantive objections to the DABâ€™s actions, and challenging the findings regarding the patientâ€™s instability and the hospitalâ€™s refusal of the transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The following are among the interpretations and conclusions made by the court:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">"Stability," as used in the medical profession, does not carry the same meaning as "stabilized" under EMTALA.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">A request made by an emergency physician to a receiving hospital to accept a transfer is not required to be precise, as long as the statement generally indicates the desire to arrange a transfer.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">Although the receiving hospital argued that its on-call surgeon was not authorized to refuse a transfer, it conceded that its emergency physician had authority to accept or refuse a transfer. Therefore, the hospital was liable when the emergency physician communicated the refusal of the on-call surgeon to accept the patient.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">The transferring physicianâ€™s judgment will be accorded weight in determining the stability of the patient:<p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-6">We note that as a practical matter, however, any hospital with specialized capabilities or facilities that refuses a request to transfer an unstabilized patient risks violating [EMTALA] to the extent that it chooses to second-guess the medical judgment of the transferring hospital.</p></li></ol></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a>Can a receiving hospital ask why a patient is being transferred?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In addition to determining the patientâ€™s condition and clinical needs, an accepting hospital should be able to inquire as to the medical reason(s) for the transfer. As discussed above, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> permit a hospital to decline a "lateral transfer." If the receiving hospital believes that the transferring hospital is able to provide the level of service required for stabilizing the patientâ€™s EMC, the receiving hospital should be able to inquire as to the medical reason(s) for the transfer in order to determine whether it is a lateral transfer, including asking about the beds, services, equipment or specialty physician coverage that may be available.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">However, inquiries as to the capability of the sending hospital may be viewed as delaying or discouraging a necessary transfer, or as second-guessing the decision of the sending physician. If a transferring hospital indicates that it lacks the present capability or capacity to provide the stabilizing treatment required for the patient, the receiving hospital should accept the transfer (if it has the capacity and capability to do so) and make appropriate inquiries after the patient has arrived at the receiving facility about the capacity and capability of the transferring hospital at the time of transfer.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>When can a hospital refuse to accept a transfer?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">A receiving hospital may refuse to accept a transfer of an emergency patient with an EMC in five circumstances:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">The patient is an inpatient at the transferring hospital;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">The transferring hospital is not located in the United States (which, for EMTALA purposes, includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands);</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">The patientâ€™s EMC is stabilized (in other words, EMTALA does not apply to the transfer), as determined by the transferring physician.

The hospital may then advise the transferring hospital that it is willing to admit and treat the patient subject to financial or insurance clearance, including obtaining prior authorization for the post-stabilization services.

The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> state that EMTALA permits a receiving hospital to refuse a "lateral transfer" in some instances (although state law or contractual obligations may require the hospital to accept the patient). However, if a transferring hospital is operating beyond its capacity (e.g., there are no ICU beds available) or has an equipment malfunction, then a receiving hospital may be obligated to accept a transfer because the transferring hospital, at the time of the transfer, does not have an equivalent level of care as the receiving hospital.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The obligations of hospitals under California law to accept transfers in certain situations are discussed at the end of this chapter.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>Are there different standards for acceptance of a transfer of a patient who has a psychiatric emergency medical condition?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">As discussed in chapter 6, there is no distinction under the EMTALA rules between the transfer of an individual with a medical EMC or an individual with a psychiatric EMC. Some California counties have published guidance that attempts to limit the transfer of involuntary psychiatric patients to specified facilities; for example, guidance published in 2012 and again in 2014 by a California county stated that "[s]ending patients on an involuntary hold to hospitals not designated by [<span class="CharOverride-4"> 			</span>] County is illegal." However, the EMTALA regulations do not prohibit a transferring hospital from arranging an appropriate transfer of an individual with an unstabilized EMC, whether medical or psychiatric, to <span class="Bold">any</span> facility that has the capacity and capability to stabilize the individualâ€™s EMC. This expressly permits a hospital to transfer an emergency department patient with an unstabilized psychiatric condition to any hospital within or outside of the county in which the sending hospital is located, as well as across state lines if necessary to find a facility that has the capacity and capability to stabilize the emergency psychiatric condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Conversely, a receiving hospital cannot refuse an appropriate transfer from an emergency department of an individual with an EMC, whether medical or psychiatric, if it has the capacity and capability to stabilize the individualâ€™s EMC. In some cases, a county behavioral health department or mental health plan may try to limit the number of admissions of involuntary patients at a contracting facility. However, if the contracting facility has the capability and capacity to stabilize a psychiatric patientâ€™s condition, it cannot decline the transfer due to the limitations imposed by the county or health plan. Similarly, it cannot refuse to accept EMTALA patients with unstabilized psychiatric conditions who are transferred across county lines.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Can a hospital refuse a transfer if there are hospitals closer to the transferring hospital that can provide the required services?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">EMTALA does not permit a receiving hospital to refuse an emergency transfer because another receiving hospital is closer to the transferring hospital and can provide the higher level of care required for the patient.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Although EMTALA requires a receiving hospital to accept the appropriate transfer of an emergency patient with an unstabilized EMC, it does not require the transferring hospital to select the closest available hospital that provides the higher level of care required by the patient. Rather, EMTALA assumes that the transferring physician will exercise good faith professional judgment in selecting the receiving hospital. This should not preclude a receiving hospital at a lengthy distance from the transferring hospital to inquire of the transferring hospital as to the availability of a closer hospital, although it should be clearly communicated to the transferring hospital that the inquiry is made for informational purposes to understand the circumstances of the transfer, and not as a condition or barrier to acceptance of the transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">A hospital may also not refuse a transfer because the patient is from out of state, even if there is another receiving hospital closer to the transferring hospital. In an OIG settlement reported in the OIG Semiannual Report to Congress for Oct. 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016, the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) allegedly failed to accept the appropriate transfer of a patient who needed specialized capabilities of the hospital to stabilize her emergency medical condition. UMMC refused the transfer request because of a UMMC policy that it would not accept the transfer of Louisiana residents. The OIG reported that UMMC entered into a $50,000 settlement agreement to resolve the alleged EMTALA violation.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a>Can a hospital place conditions on accepting a transfer?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In a 2007 CMS memorandum (S&amp;C 07-20) subsequently incorporated into tag. no. A-241<span class="No-break">1/C</span>-2411of the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> (included in Appendix C), CMS declared that placing conditions on the acceptance of transfers is disfavored by CMS, and will likely subject the receiving hospital to an EMTALA violation. In the memorandum, CMS reported that the EMTALA Technical Advisory Group had received testimony regarding situations where a hospital had refused to accept a transfer unless the transferring hospital used an air medical service owned by the receiving hospital for the transfer. As stated in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-7">A hospital with specialized capabilities or facilities that has the necessary capacity to treat an individual with an emergency medical condition may not condition or attempt to condition its acceptance of an appropriate transfer of an individual protected under EMTALA on the use of a particular mode of transport or transport service.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In addition, CMS has cautioned hospitals against patient delays or disparate treatment of patients based on financial or insurance status:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-7">If a managed care member comes to a hospital that offers emergency services, the hospital must provide the services required under the EMTALA statute without regard for the individualâ€™s insurance status or any prior authorization requirement of such insurance. This requirement applies equally to both referring and receiving (recipient) hospitals. Therefore, it may be a violation if the receiving hospital delays acceptance of an individual with an unstabilized EMC pending receipt or verification of financial informationâ€¦</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">For instance, if there is evidence that the receiving hospital unreasonably delayed the treatment of certain individuals and expedited the treatment of other individuals, based on their ability to pay for the services or some other form of discrimination, then the receiving hospital may be in violation of EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Hospitals have been sanctioned under EMTALA, including receiving fines, for requesting pre-admission deposits or limiting acceptance of transfers to patients residing in the same county as the receiving hospital. A request from the receiving hospital at the time of transfer for a payment guarantee will likely be considered a possible violation of EMTALA. In addition, requests to the transferring hospital to perform additional tests or arrange for an on-call consultation may constitute a violation if the transferring physician believes that there is an immediate need for the transfer or the request of the receiving facility will delay an appropriate transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Some receiving hospitals have attempted to limit their acceptance of a patient with an EMC to the provision of the specialized services that necessitated the transfer. After the specialized services have been rendered and the patient is stable, the receiving hospital plans to return the patient to the transferring hospital for further inpatient care if safe to do so. These arrangements are often contained in transfer agreements between two hospitals that are signed outside the immediacy of accepting a transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">A "take-back" agreement should not be raised at the time of a request to accept a transfer. In view of the position taken by CMS in the memorandum, imposing a "take-back" condition at the time of a transfer request (in the absence of a prior arrangement in a transfer agreement between the two hospitals) may place the receiving hospital in jeopardy of an EMTALA violation if the transferring hospital rejects the condition and reports the receiving hospital for refusing the transfer in the absence of accepting the "take-back" condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip _idGenParaOverride-8"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> It is strongly recommended that conditions for accepting a transfer not be made on an ad hoc basis at the time of a requested transfer because the discussions could delay an appropriate transfer of an emergency patient.

Under EMTALA, the receiving hospital must utilize its resources, including its medical staff, to evaluate and stabilize the patient.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">By extension, a physician on call to the receiving hospital has the same obligation as the hospital to accept a patient with an unstabilized EMC and to come to the hospital to treat the patient. If an on-call physician is available to accept the transfer of an unstabilized emergency patient, the receiving hospital has the capability and capacity to treat the patient and the transfer is otherwise appropriate under the circumstances. A refusal by the on-call physician to accept the patient may result in an EMTALA violation by the hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">As discussed above, the on-call physician in the <span class="Italic">St. Anthony Hospital</span> case refused to accept a patient transfer. Although the receiving hospital argued that its on-call surgeon was not authorized to refuse a transfer, it conceded that its emergency physician had authority to accept or refuse a transfer. Therefore, the hospital was liable for an EMTALA violation when the emergency physician communicated the refusal of the on-call surgeon to accept the patient. <span class="Italic">(See chapter 11, "Physician On-Call Responsibilities," for additional guidance about on-call physician responsibilities.)</span></p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip _idGenParaOverride-8"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> Many hospitals have received an EMTALA sanction where, without their knowledge, an on-call physician refuses to accept an appropriate transfer.

In the 2004 <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, CMS deleted the concept of "stable for transfer," stating instead that an EMC must be resolved before the condition is considered to be stabilized. As discussed in chapter 5, "Transferring or Discharging an Emergency Patient," and set forth in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> in Appendix C, the transfer of a patient with an unresolved EMC who is nonetheless clinically stable for transfer requires compliance with the EMTALA standards for an appropriate transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In communications between sending and receiving hospitals, facility personnel need to be clear as to whether the patient has an emergency medical condition that is "unstabilized." CMS has warned that the use of the word "stable" may be misinterpreted as suggesting that the emergency condition is "stabilized."</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The concerns about using "stable" are illustrated in a 2013 guidance (Appendix X) issued by CMS. In the letter, CMS cautioned hospitals that "the statutory definition of an individualâ€™s EMC being â€˜stabilizedâ€™ does not necessarily equate to an individual being clinically stable."</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-7">The similarity of the terms "clinically stable" and "stabilized" appears to cause confusion among hospitals, practitioners and other hospital staff. It is not uncommon for practitioners to find that an individual has become "clinically stable," often understood to mean the normalization of the individualâ€™s vital signs, and then conclude that the hospitalâ€™s EMTALA obligation has ended. However, if the EMC has not been stabilized, as that term is defined ... [by the EMTALA regulations], EMTALA continues to apply. For example, a patient diagnosed with appendicitis might have relatively normal vital signs, but is still in need of surgery, and therefore continues to have an EMC that has not been stabilized.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-7">Furthermore, many practitioners and some third-party payors seem to assume that if an individual can withstand the risk of a transfer, then that means the individual has been stabilized and the hospitalâ€™s EMTALA obligation has ended. This also is not necessarily the case. This mistaken assumption can be reflected in the commonly used term "stable for transfer." "Stable for transfer" is not a term used in EMTALA, and it is not necessarily equivalent to the term "stabilized," as defined for EMTALA purposes. Use of this term can, therefore, be very misleading. [CMS Survey and Certification Memo No. 14-06 (Dec. 13, 2013)]</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Because CMS considers the transfer of a patient with an unresolved EMC to implicate the EMTALA transfer requirements, it is likely that the receiving hospital has a corresponding obligation to accept the patient who requires a higher level of care than the transferring facility can provide.

In the absence of guidance, the hospital must decide whether to accept the transfer of the patient (and possibly violate the nurse staffing ratios) or refuse the transfer on the basis of staffing constraints.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">If the hospital accepts and admits the patient when it is out of compliance with staffing ratios, a surveyor may later cite the hospital under state law, which may subject the facility to fines or other sanctions under state and federal laws, as well as litigation by the patient if there is an adverse outcome. If the hospital declines the transfer, a surveyor may later review the admission patterns at the time of the transfer (were other patients admitted or transferred?) and the historical practices of the hospital in admitting or transferring patients in similar situations; the survey could result in an EMTALA violation, as well as potential litigation if there is an adverse outcome.

Therefore, if a receiving hospital is asked to accept the transfer of a health plan enrollee who has an unstabilized EMC and needs a higher level of care, the hospital should accept the patient if it has the capacity and capability to provide the services. The hospital should confirm the patientâ€™s condition with the transferring hospital or physician, and ensure that it obtains a copy of the physicianâ€™s certification for the transfer. Following the admission of the patient at the receiving hospital, the hospital should seek authorization for services that will be required for the patient after he or she is stabilized.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">If a receiving hospital is asked to accept the transfer of a health plan emergency patient whose condition is stabilized (i.e., the EMC is resolved), but needs post-stabilization services at a facility providing a higher level of care, the receiving hospital should confirm with the transferring hospital or physician that the patientâ€™s condition is stabilized. The hospital may then advise the transferring hospital that it is willing to admit and treat the patient subject to obtaining prior authorization for the post-stabilization services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">As discussed in chapter 4, "Financial Considerations â€” EMTALA and Managed Care," the transferring hospital may have an obligation to contact the health plan prior to sending an enrollee to a non-contract hospital for post-stabilization services.

As noted by CMS, a person acting on the patientâ€™s behalf cannot refuse examination, treatment or a transfer unless the patient is incapable of making an informed decision for himself or herself. The patientâ€™s medical record must contain a description of the proposed examination, treatment or transfer that was offered by the hospital but refused by the patient.

In some cases, the patient tells a nurse or clerk that he or she feels better, and leaves the hospital. In other cases, the patient tells a nurse or clerk that he or she does not want to wait for  the medical screening examination or that he or she will go elsewhere (to a primary care physician or another facility). In other cases, the patient simply elopes and is not in the waiting room when called for his or her medical screening examination.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In all of these cases, the patient has presented for emergency services, but has not received a medical screening examination. Without a medical examination, the patient cannot be said to be leaving against medical advice (AMA), since the hospital does not have sufficient medical information to inform the patient of the risks of leaving the hospital. However, the triage report often documents the presenting complaint, vital signs and other preliminary findings that provide regulators with information sufficient to speculate as to whether the patient had a potential emergency medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">These types of cases have been the focus of EMTALA enforcement actions. Hospitals have been cited by CMS and subject to potential OIG sanctions for failing to provide a medical screening examination to a person presenting to the emergency department for emergency services. The lack of a medical screening examination an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r inadequate documentation of the patientâ€™s reasons for leaving puts the hospital at a severe disadvantage when later explaining the circumstances for the patientâ€™s departure and defending the speculation of the regulators as to the potential condition of the patient.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In the preamble to the Special Advisory Bulletin (see Appendix H), CMS and the OIG advise that hospitals should be very concerned about patients leaving without being screened, especially if due to waiting times:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-5">Since every patient who presents seeking emergency services is entitled to  a medical screening examination, a hospital could violate the patient anti- dumping statute if it routinely keeps patients waiting so long that they leave without being seen, particularly if the hospital does not attempt to determine and document why individual patients are leaving, and reiterate to them that the hospital is prepared to provide a medical screening if they stay.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">This advice reinforces the need for hospitals to monitor waiting times for emergency services and the rate of patient departures before the provision of the medical screening examination.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip _idGenParaOverride-6"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> Hospitals should develop quality management measures to determine the reasons for patient departures, and implement actions as appropriate to reduce unacceptable rates of patient elopement. In addition, patient registration, reception and other emergency staff should receive periodic in-service reminders of the need to document 1) early patient departures and elopements, and 2) communication to patients offering the medical screening and encouraging patients to stay for their examination. For example, some hospitals have developed information sheets to hand to patients at triage informing them of the medical screening, encouraging patients to remain for their examination by the emergency physician, and urging them to inform the triage nurse or other emergency staff if they decide to leave the dedicated emergency department or other hospital location before they receive their medical screening.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>Patient Elopes or Leaves Without Notice</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">If a patient elopes or leaves the hospital without advising personnel in the dedicated emergency department or other location as to his or her reasons for leaving, the hospital, to the best of its ability, should document the circumstances of the patientâ€™s departure. It is recommended that hospital personnel call the patientâ€™s name in the waiting area several times, and note the times in the medical record. If the patient does not respond, the medical record should include the time when hospital staff became aware of the departure and any other pertinent information related to the patient and his or her medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Some hospitals have initiated patient follow-up call programs where they telephone eloped patients within a few days after their emergency visits to inquire as to the reasons for leaving the hospital and their present medical status. This information has been used effectively by  a hospital in responding to allegations of the quality improvement organization (QIO) that the hospital failed to provide medical screening examinations to a number of patients who allegedly may have had emergency medical conditions (based on triage data). Using the information derived from the follow-up calls, the hospital was able to demonstrate that the patients left the hospital for valid reasons (such as the patient felt better) and were in good health.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Patient Gives Reason for Leaving</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">If a patient advises the hospital that he or she is leaving prior to the medical screening, the hospital should make every effort to offer the patient the examination, encourage the patient to wait and, if unsuccessful, obtain from the patient the reasons for leaving the hospital. Some hospitals have developed forms for refusal of a medical screening examination. Regardless of whether the patient signs a form, the hospital should document the patientâ€™s reasons for leaving. The documentation should be sufficiently detailed to reply to a subsequent complaint from the patient or a licensing surveyor that the hospital refused or discouraged the patient from receiving a medical screening examination. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> state that the medical record should reflect that the hospital offered to provide screening and treatment before the patientâ€™s refusal.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a>Patient Departs for Financial Reasons</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">One of the more difficult situations is handling the patient who leaves the hospital before the medical screening examination due to financial reasons. Often, a patient will ask hospital personnel how much his or her emergency services will cost or whether it accepts the patientâ€™s managed care plan, and then leave the hospital without receiving emergency services. CMS has repeatedly cautioned hospitals that discussing payment obligations when a patient is deciding on whether to accept or refuse treatment will be closely scrutinized to determine whether the hospital discouraged the patient from seeking further treatment. CMS has warned that hospitals "may not attempt to coerce individuals into making judgments against their interest by informing them that they will have to pay for their care if they remain but that their care will be free or at lower cost if they transfer to another hospital."</p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip _idGenParaOverride-6"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> It is recommended that hospitals have clear guidelines for staff to handle these situations, and ensure, through in-service education and policies, that hospitals offer to provide emergency services, encourage the patient to stay and document the circumstances of and reasons for the patientâ€™s decision to decline further care.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a>Documentation of Risks and Benefits</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Under the EMTALA regulations, a hospital must inform a patient of the risks and benefits of refusing further examination and treatment. The regulation applies this obligation to a refusal of the further examination and treatment rendered after a patient has received a medical screening examination.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">If the patient withdraws his or her request for a medical screening before the examination has been performed, the hospital may not have sufficient medical information to describe the risks and benefits to the individual if he or she leaves the hospital. This is consistent with a statement by CMS and OIG in the Special Advisory Bulletin that prior to performing the medical screening examination, a hospital is "ill-informed" to advise a health plan of the patientâ€™s condition. The rationale for this position is that prior to receiving a medical screening, the patient has not been examined by a qualified professional who has obtained the requisite clinical knowledge to advise a health plan of the patientâ€™s medical status. If a hospital is "ill-informed" to advise a managed care plan of a patientâ€™s condition, then it should be equally "ill-informed" to advise the patient of the risks and benefits of withdrawing a request for a medical screening examination.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">However, this interpretation of EMTALA is not necessarily held by CMS and the OIG. A number of hospitals have been cited by these agencies for their failure to inform a patient withdrawing a request for the medical screening of the risks and benefits of leaving the hospital prior to his or her examination. Regardless of what action a hospital takes with respect to a patient who withdraws his or her request for the medical screening prior to the performance of the examination, hospitals should take (and document) every step taken to offer and encourage the patient to remain for his or her medical screening examination.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-2"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-7">42 C.F.R.

Even if a patient leaves before triage or a medical screening examination, his or her name should be recorded in the central log. At a minimum, every dedicated emergency department of the hospital should maintain    a central log. These departments include the emergency department, labor and delivery service, psychiatric service, urgent care center and other ambulatory departments that meet the definition of a dedicated emergency department <span class="Italic">(see chapter 2, "When and Where Does EMTALA Begin and End?")</span>.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>Are off-campus departments required to maintain a central log?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The 2003 revisions to the EMTALA regulations eliminated the need for an off-campus hospital department to maintain a central log unless the department is a dedicated emergency department.

Some states, such as California, also have licensing regulations requiring emergency departments to have on-call rosters.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The on-call list must meet the needs of emergency patients in accordance with the resources available to the hospital, including the availability of on-call physicians. The on-call physicians are considered resources available to a dedicated emergency department that must be used to provide emergency services for an individual who has or may have an EMC. Under the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, a hospital is expected to know "prospectively" the identity of its on-call physicians. CMS has also published separate guidance for on-call coverage of critical access hospitals <span class="Italic">(see Appendix Y, discussed under </span><a href="EMTALA_Chap11_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor007" data-href="_idTextAnchor007"><span class="Italic">D.&nbsp;"Are there special rules for critical access hospitals?" </span></a><span class="Italic">)</span>.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> identify three "permitted on-call options" for meeting the coverage obligations:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Coverage physicians may perform elective surgery or other procedures during the period that they are on-call.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Simultaneous call, i.e., a physician may be on-call at the same time at two or more hospitals; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Participation in a formal community call plan that meets certain regulatory criteria. </li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Some states have also adopted regulations that address the requirements for on-call coverage. For example, California law requires hospitals with licensed emergency departments to maintain on-call rosters and have full-time coverage of certain clinical specialties. Additional state requirements apply to hospitals with base-station and trauma designation status. Physicians who serve on call must provide emergency services without regard to a personâ€™s race, color, ethnicity, religion, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, age, sex, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, pre-existing medical condition, physical or mental disability, insurance status, economic status, ability to pay and other categories protected by state law, except where age, sex, pre-existing medical condition or physical or mental disability is medically significant to the provision of appropriate medical care to the patient.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">There have been a number of studies and reports regarding on-call coverage and the changes in physician willingness to accept call obligations. One of the most comprehensive reports was published in 2003 by the California Senate Office of Research with the input of a large, multi-disciplinary task force of physicians, hospitals, health plans, government agencies, consumers and others interested in emergency services. The report, "Stretched Thin: Growing Gaps in Californiaâ€™s Emergency Room Backup System," is available at <a href="http://sor.senate.ca.gov/sites/sor.senate.ca.gov/files/Stretched%20Thin.pdf" target="_system">http://sor.senate.ca.go<span class="No-break">v/s</span>ite<span class="No-break">s/s</span>or.senate.ca.go<span class="No-break">v/f</span>ile<span class="No-break">s/S</span>tretched%20Thin.pdf</a>.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text"><span class="All-Caps-Bold">Note:</span> This chapter does not address payment arrangements with physicians for on-call coverage. To date, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) has issued three Advisory Opinions addressing payment to physicians for on-call coverage. The first was issued on Sept. 20, 2007 (Advisory Opinion 07-10); the second was issued on May 14, 2009 (Advisory Opinion 09-05); and the third was issued on Oct. 30, 2012 (Advisory Opinion 12-15, Modification to Advisory Opinion 12-15). The opinions are posted on the OIG website (<a href="http://oig.hhs.gov" target="_system">http://oig.hhs.gov</a>).

In the 2009 <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) states that the on-call obligations apply not only to hospitals with dedicated emergency departments, but also to hospitals that must accept appropriate transfers of individuals with EMCs. Effective in 2017, the EMTALA civil money penalties and exclusion regulations were revised to clarify that an on-call physician subject to sanctions includes not only a physician on-call to the treating hospital, but also a physician on-call to a receiving hospital that is requested to accept an appropriate transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-4">42 C.F.R.

CMS has declined, however, to require that every medical and surgical specialty represented on the hospital medical staff have a call schedule. Under the EMTALA regulations, CMS requires that all hospital departments that are dedicated emergency departments, including labor and delivery, psychiatric services and urgent care centers, should have on-call coverage.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">States may impose additional requirements for on-call coverage. For example, in California:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The hospital licensing regulations require hospitals providing basic 24-hour emergency services to provide on-call coverage for the basic services required for licensure (i.e., radiology, general surgery, pathology, anesthesia and general medicine) and for supplemental services listed on the hospital license (e.g., psychiatry, pediatrics and obstetrics).</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">There are additional on-call requirements for trauma facilities and for hospitals that have contractual arrangements to provide on-call coverage.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">Hospitals operating standby emergency services are required to have a physician on-call at all times to respond within a reasonable time relative to the patientâ€™s illness or injury.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">Basic, comprehensive and standby emergency services are all required to maintain a roster of specialty physicians who are available for consultation at all times. The failure to maintain a roster of on-call physicians has, in least one instance, been held by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) to constitute "immediate jeopardy," for which administrative sanctions may be imposed.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">An acute psychiatric hospital is required to have a psychiatrist available at all times for psychiatric emergencies.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References">42 C.F.R.

There is no requirement under the EMTALA regulations that all of the hospitalâ€™s clinical specialties be listed on the on-call roster at all times. CMS has explained that it has not set requirements on how frequently physicians are expected to provide on-call coverage. Therefore, except for more extensive requirements under state law (such as full-time on-call coverage for certain professional services that is discussed immediately above), coverage for other specialties that are represented on the hospital medical staff may be full-time or part-time.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">There is no bright-line test under EMTALA for determining when coverage must be full-time for specialties that are not required to have full-time coverage under state law or other contractual obligations. CMS has explicitly rejected the long-standing misconception that call coverage must be full-time if there are three or more physicians in a particular specialty.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Under EMTALA, there are no fixed standards for part-time coverage, including the frequency of coverage by an individual physician (such as three to five days per month) or the periodicity of coverage (consecutive days, weekdays or weekends). These decisions are delegated to each hospital and its medical staff. However, the EMTALA regulations require a hospital to have written policies and procedures for handling emergency patients when a particular specialty is not available.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">As noted above, the primary guidance for on-call coverage is that coverage should be consistent with the hospitalâ€™s services and resources, including the availability of on-call physicians.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, CMS lists the following factors that hospitals may consider in establishing the frequency of on-call coverage:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The number of physicians on the medical staff in a specialty;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">Other demands on staff physicians (such as patient care obligations, conferences, vacations, days off and similar factors);</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The frequency with which the hospitalâ€™s patients typically require the services of on- call physicians (for example, a hospital should consider the predictable demand for specialty services, such as orthopedic or cardiac emergencies, when scheduling its on-call specialists); and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The provisions that a hospital has made for situations when on-call coverage is unavailable or the physician on-call is unable to respond due to circumstances beyond his or her control.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Other factors that should be considered are the representations made by the hospital on its website and in its promotional and educational materials that describe the availability of services at the hospital (especially statements that a particular service is available at all times).</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In addition, in at least one instance, CMS validated an EMTALA violation for failure to provide full-time coverage of a specific clinical specialty based on the review of the hospitalâ€™s on-call coverage contracts with specialists on the medical staff. In the statement of deficiencies, CMS noted that the contract provided that the on-call physicians would accept call on a basis that was sufficient to ensure coverage for the specialty seven days a week, including holidays.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">CMS provides another example in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> for assessing the adequacy of on-call coverage:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style">For instance, if the hospital under investigation performs a significant amount of interventional cardiac catheterizations and holds itself out to the public through various advertising methods as a center of excellence in providing this specialized procedure to the community, it would be reasonable to expect that there would be adequate on-call coverage by a physician who is able to perform an emergent interventional cardiac procedure on individuals who present to that hospitalâ€™s DED in need of such an intervention or who are appropriately transferred to that hospital for such an intervention.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References">42 C.F.R.

Under the Medicare Conditions of Participation (CoP) for a CAH, a physician, PA, NP or a clinical nurse specialist with training or experience in emergency care must be immediately available by telephone or radio, and available on-site within 30 minutes (60 minutes in a frontier area that meets certain conditions). While the CAH is required to have an on-call roster reasonably related to its services and medical staff members, this does not require that the staff physicians must be on-call and available to respond in person at all times, including every case involving an individual with an emergency medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The CAH CoPs require that a physician must be immediately available by telephone or radio contact on a continuous basis to receive emergency calls, provide information on the treatment of emergency patients, and refer patients. CMS guidance issued in 2013 (Appendix Y) indicates that this requirement may be met by a staff physician or a telemedicine physician. CMS does not require that a telemedicine physician must be listed on the on-call roster; in fact, CMS states that it is not advisable to do so.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">However, state laws for emergency services, such as standby emergency services in California, may require that a physician be available at all times to come to the hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-4">CMS Survey and Certification Memorandum 13-38: Critical Access Hospital Emergency Services and Telemedicine (June 7, 2013) (Appendix Y)</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>Can the medical staff exempt senior physicians from on-call coverage?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The responsibility to maintain on-call coverage is vested in the hospital and its medical staff.

The requirement that the dedicated emergency department must be prospectively aware of which physicians are on call means that a medical specialty or medical group cannot simply list all of its members and request that the emergency physician call the members in order to find an available physician when needed.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-7">In the past, CMS has indicated that it will look at how a hospital meets its on-call responsibilities not only by a review of the on-call roster, but also by the past practices of the physicians who are on call or "available" to the hospital. In the preamble to the 2003 regulations, CMS reiterated that the practice of refusing to be listed on the on-call roster, but taking calls selectively (for example, based on insurance status), "would clearly be a violation of EMTALA" [68 Fed. Reg. 53255]. This policy is reinforced in Interpretive Guidelines. However, if a hospital permits physicians to selectively take call only for their own established patients who present to the ED for evaluation, then the hospital must be careful to assure that it maintains adequate on-call services, and that the selective call policy is not a substitute for the on-call services required by the Medicare provider agreement.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">If a physician has a de facto pattern of accepting on-call responsibilities, an enforcement agency may determine that his or her conduct is tantamount to being on call and hold the hospital responsible for permitting a coverage physician to refuse acceptance of an emergency patient or failing to come to the hospital when requested to do so by an emergency physician.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">One of the continuing issues of on-call coverage is whether a physician must respond to the request of an emergency physician if he or she believes that the emergency patient requires services that are within the scope of his or her clinical privileges but beyond the scope of his or her actual practice (for example, various orthopedic subspecialty procedures). In the preamble to the 2003 regulations, CMS noted that a physician:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-7">who is in a narrow subspecialty may, in fact, be medically competent in his or her general specialty, and in particular may be able to promptly contribute to the individualâ€™s care by bringing skills and expertise that are not available to the emergency physicianâ€¦ [68 Fed.

For example, the hospital should adopt a chain of command policy specifying the personnel (such as department or section chair, or the administrator-on-call) to be contacted in the event of an on-call failure.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">If an on-call physician fails to meet his or her obligations under EMTALA or state law, the hospital should consider the following actions:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a>Document in the patient medical record the time of notification of the requested transfer and the request made to the on-call physician, the response time of the physician, and other pertinent information related to the failure of the on-call physician to meet his or her obligations;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">Contact the chief of service or other designated person to enforce the call obligation;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">Contact other staff physicians in the same specialty who may be available to see the patient in a timely manner;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">Contact other area hospitals providing the specialty service to arrange for an appropriate transfer if other qualified physicians are not available to see the patient;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">Transfer the patient in accordance with EMTALA guidelines;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">Document in the medical record the name and address of the on-call physician who refused to consult and examine the patient (this documentation is expressly required by the EMTALA statute); and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">Report the failure to the hospitalâ€™s quality improvement and risk management programs, and initiate, where appropriate, a follow-up review of the actions of the on-call physician and the hospital by the medical staff and hospital administration.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, CMS notes that if an on-call physician does not fulfill his or her obligation to come to the hospital for an emergency patient, but the hospital arranges for another staff physician to assess the patient (and there are no other EMTALA violations), the hospital will not be cited for the on-call failure. However, the call physician who failed to respond may be in violation of EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">However, if the on-call failure results in a transfer of the patient to another facility, then the hospital will be subject to a CMS enforcement action and both the hospital and the on-call physician may be subject to civil money penalties imposed by the OIG. As discussed in chapter 5, "Transferring or Discharging an Emergency Patient," a hospital transferring a patient due to an on-call failure or refusal to respond must list the name and address of the on-call physician in the patient record that is sent to the receiving facility.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The oversight and enforcement of on-call coverage is a medical staff responsibility. Hospitals should expect that the enforcement agencies will inquire as to whether the medical staff has monitored the compliance of on-call physicians and taken appropriate disciplinary action against an on-call physician who refuses to accept an emergency patient or fails to come to the hospital in a timely manner to provide necessary consultation or other required services for a patient with an EMC.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References">42 C.F.R.

In general, the report should be made to the appropriate CMS regional office or the local field office of the state survey agency.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a>What is the penalty for not filing a report?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Under EMTALA, the failure of a receiving hospital to report a suspected EMTALA violation by a transferring hospital is grounds for termination of the receiving hospitalâ€™s Medicare provider agreement. CMS has indicated that it will review the actions of all hospitals involved in an EMTALA complaint, and will take action against a receiving facility for failure to report an EMTALA violation. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> require surveyors to "look for evidence" by reviewing medical records or interviewing patients, family members and staff that a receiving hospital knew or suspected that a patient had been transferred in violation of EMTALA standards.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>Are there state reporting requirements?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Some states have adopted additional requirements for reporting patient-dumping violations. For example, California law requires a receiving hospital and its physicians and other licensed emergency care personnel to report apparent violations to CDPH within one week of the occurrence. A transferring hospital and its physicians and other licensed emergency care personnel may report apparent violations to CDPH within one week of the occurrence. The complaint must be forwarded to the transferring hospital and the local emergency medical services agency, unless CDPH concludes that the complaint does not require further investigation, is unmeritorious, or its investigation of the allegations would be impeded by disclosure.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>Is a hospital required to self-report a violation of EMTALA or the state anti- dumping laws?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">There is no requirement under the EMTALA regulations that a hospital must self-report an EMTALA violation that it has or may have committed. State licensing laws (Health and Safety Code Section 1317.4(c)) permit a transferring hospital or its personnel to report an apparent violation to CDPH. As discussed below, hospital personnel or physicians who report a suspected EMTALA or state law violation are protected under anti-retaliation laws.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">If a hospital has identified a potential violation of EMTALA or state emergency laws, the hospital should consider the merits of self-reporting even if a report is not required. In some cases, if a hospital self-reports a violation before a complaint by another hospital or person is filed with CMS or the state survey agency, and the hospital has immediately addressed and appropriately corrected the circumstances that resulted in the violation, CMS may (but is not required to) limit the scope of the EMTALA investigation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In a 2016 Final Rule, the OIG addressed self-reporting as a mitigating factor to reduce the potential amount of civil money penalties for an EMTALA violation. The OIG indicated that taking appropriate and timely corrective action in response to an EMTALA violation would be considered a potential mitigating factor. However, the OIG stated that:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">Mitigating corrective actions must be completed before CMS initiates an investigation of the hospital and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">The hospital must self-report the violation to CMS before CMS receives a complaint about the violation from another source.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As an example where self-reporting may be appropriate, a hospital self-reported an on-call violation where a specialist refused to come to the emergency department to treat a patient with an emergency medical condition. The hospital reported the circumstances to CMS  and CDPH, along with a timeline of the event and a corrective action plan. CMS limited the survey to the incident and confirmed the violation. In a subsequent investigation, the OIG substantially reduced the civil penalty assessed against the hospital (which would have been much higher had the incident not been self-reported).</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">On the other hand, hospitals should thoroughly review the facts of a suspected violation, and consult with legal counsel as appropriate, before self-reporting a violation. As an example, a hospital self-reported an event as an EMTALA violation that did not even implicate the EMTALA obligations. The follow-up investigation led to a multi-day survey that, through the review of patient records unrelated to the self-reported case, identified not only serious violations in the emergency department, but also in labor and delivery.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Is a violation of EMTALA or the state emergency services laws reportable to CDPH as an "adverse event?"<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Effective July 1, 2007, California hospitals must report "adverse events" to CDPH. A violation of EMTALA or the state emergency service laws is not itself a reportable event.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">However, the circumstances surrounding the care provided to a patient who is covered by EMTALA or the state emergency services laws may fall into one of the categories of adverse events that must be reported to CDPH. Hospitals that identify an adverse event, or another circumstance involving an emergency patient, that may be reportable (such as elder or child abuse) should review CHAâ€™s <span class="Italic">Consent Manual</span> or consult with legal counsel.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker005"></a>Can a hospital retaliate against a physician or staff member who reports an EMTALA or state anti-dumping law violation?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As discussed in chapter 13, "Regulatory Enforcement of EMTALA," EMTALA and some states have adopted laws that prohibit retaliation against personnel or physicians who report an EMTALA or state law violation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Under EMTALA, a hospital may not penalize or take adverse action against a physician or another qualified professional because that person refused to authorize the transfer of an individual with an emergency medical condition that had not been stabilized.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Some states also have anti-retaliation laws. Under California law, retaliation is prohibited against a physician or emergency personnel for reporting in good faith an apparent violation of the statute, or for refusing to transfer a patient if the physician determined, based on reasonable medical probability, that a transfer would have created a medical hazard. A hospital, government agency or person who violates the state anti-retaliation law for emergency services is subject to a civil money penalty of no more than $10,000 per violation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In addition, the California hospital licensing laws (Health and Safety Code Section 1278.5) prohibit a hospital from discriminating or retaliating against any patient, employee, medical staff member, or other health care worker for presenting a grievance or complaint, or initiating or cooperating in any governmental investigation or proceeding relating to the care, services, or conditions of that facility. Violations by hospitals are subject to a civil penalty of up to $25,000, and willful violations by an individual are a misdemeanor subject to a fine of up to $75,000, in addition to the civil penalty.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References">42 C.F.R.

							<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor002"></a>Overview of the Administrative Review Process<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker000"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker001"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker002"></a>Regulatory enforcement of EMTALA involves three agencies: the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) (with the support of state licensing surveyors), the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) and the Office of Inspector General (OIG). In addition, the <a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a>Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may follow up on a violation of EMTALA with a request for documents and information from Hill-Burton hospitals that have community service obligations.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The enforcement of EMTALA is a <a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a>complaint-driven process. Upon a confirmed EMTALA violation, CMS may suspend or <a id="_idIndexMarker005"></a>terminate a hospitalâ€™s provider agreement. The notice of suspension or termination can be 23 days (if the violations constitute immediate jeopardy) or 90 days (if the violations do not constitute immediate jeopardy).</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">All confirmed EMTALA violations must be forwarded to the OIG to determine whether civil money penalties should be imposed for the violations. In considering sanctions, OIG must request that the QIO assess the appropriateness of the medical screening examination, the presence of an emergency medical condition, patient stabilization and other clinical issues related to a possible EMTALA violation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The QIO assessment, referred to as the 60-day review, is an important part of the enforcement process and a potential opportunity to reduce or eliminate possible civil money sanctions if the assessment is favorable to the hospital. Hospitals should be aware that, in at least one instance, an OIG enforcement attorney has advised that failure to respond to or participate in a QIO 60-day review may increase the likelihood or amount of civil money penalties.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Under the EMTALA statute (Appendix A), the OIG has the authority to impose civil money penalties up to $50,000 against hospitals and physicians ($25,000 for hospitals with less than 100 beds), an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r to exclude a hospital or physician from the Medicare and Medicaid programs for violations of EMTALA that are "gross and flagrant or repeated." In December, 2016, the OIG issued final regulations updating the amount of civil money penalties, including EMTALA fines. Effective in 2017, the OIG may now impose civil penalties up to $104,826 against hospitals and physicians ($52,414 for hospitals with less than 100 beds) for an EMTALA violation. The maximum amounts of the fines are subject to annual adjustment for inflation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker006"></a>Physicians may be <a id="_idIndexMarker007"></a>penalized for:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">Signing a certification for transfer if a physician knew or should have known that the benefits of the transfer did not outweigh the risks, or misrepresenting a patientâ€™s condition or other information; or<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2"> </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">Failing or refusing to respond within a reasonable period of time (while serving as an on-call physician) after being requested to come to the hospital to examine, treat, or transfer a patient. This applies to on-call physicians at the hospital where the individual presents initially, as well as on-call physicians at a hospital with specialized capabilities or facilities which may receive a transferred patient; or</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">Refusing to accept an appropriate transfer, including on-call physicians.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In the 2016 regulations increasing civil money penalties for an EMTALA violation, the definition of a "responsible physician" was expanded to apply to on-call physicians. Fines may now be imposed on on-call physicians who fail or refuse to respond to a hospital that receives a request to accept an appropriate transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In the same regulations, the OIG added as a mitigating factor situations in which a hospital takes appropriate and timely corrective action in response to a violation. However, the corrective actions must be completed prior to CMS initiating an investigation of the hospital and must include disclosing the violation to CMS prior to CMS receiving a complaint regarding the violation from another source. Early corrective action and reporting to CMS does not eliminate potential liability for fines, but it may reduce the amount of fines if the OIG decides to impose penalties for the violation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In addition, the OIG may seek to exclude a physician or a hospital from the Medicare program for a violation of EMTALA. Physicians are subject to exclusion from the Medicare program for gross and flagrant, or repeated, violations. Hospitals are subject to termination of their Medicare provider agreement if they fail substantially to meet EMTALA requirements.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In 2003, CMS adopted a regulation that sanctions under EMTALA for inappropriate transfers during a national emergency (such as a bioterrorist attack) do not apply to a hospital with a dedicated emergency department located in an emergency area if certain conditions are present <span class="Italic">(see chapter 16, "Application of EMTALA to Disasters and Public Health Emergencies")</span>.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">A diagram of the EMTALA enforcement process is included in Appendix I.</p></li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor003"></a>Questions<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="All-Caps-Bold">Note:</span> CHA has published the <span class="Italic">California Hospital Survey Manual</span> that describes the scope of, and response to, CMS and California Department of Public Health (CDPH) surveys, and includes guidance for responding to CMS investigations of EMTALA compliance. The discussion in this chapter only addresses the scope and response to EMTALA surveys, as well as reviews of EMTALA compliance by the QIOs and the OIG. Hospitals should review the <span class="Italic">California Hospital Survey Manual</span> for additional information on responding to surveys and preparing plans of correction.</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"></a>What is the difference between EMTALA enforcement and other Medicare certification reviews?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">The obligation to comply with EMTALA is a term of a hospitalâ€™s Medicare provider agreement. The obligations are therefore in addition to compliance with the Conditions of Participation in the Medicare program.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">All of the EMTALA obligations are considered equal (medical screening examinations, stabilizing treatment and appropriate transfers, signage, central log, on-call roster and patient transfer records, on-call response, and reporting EMTALA violations); the failure to meet any EMTALA obligation constitutes a breach of the Medicare provider agreement, for which CMS may terminate the agreement. The notice of termination does not require a hearing prior to the termination action; instead, CMS may give a hospital notice of termination of its Medicare provider status on 23- or 90-day notice based on a survey report confirming a violation of EMTALA.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>How is an EMTALA investigation started?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">The enforcement of EMTALA is a complaint-driven process. An EMTALA investigation is usually started when a complaint is filed with CMS or the state survey agency (in California, this is CDPHâ€™s Licensing and Certification Division). The sources of complaints include patients and families, hospitals, physicians and other health care professionals, and ambulance and emergency services agencies. An EMTALA investigation may also originate from a licensing, certification or Joint Commission survey that identifies possible EMTALA violations during the course of the survey.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">Regardless of the source of an EMTALA <a id="_idIndexMarker008"></a>complaint, CMS must first determine whether the complaint identifies a possible EMTALA violation and warrants an investigation. If it does, CMS will direct the state survey agency to conduct a complaint survey (CMS can also conduct the survey). The results of the survey are forwarded to CMS, which then makes the final decision as to whether an EMTALA violation has occurred. If CMS determines that an EMTALA violation has occurred, CMS may then give notice of termination of a hospitalâ€™s Medicare provider agreement.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a>What is the frequency of EMTALA investigations?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">There is limited research or reporting of the frequency of EMTALA investigations. In a February 2017 article in the Annals of Emergency Medicine, a research team consisting of physicians and other health care professionals published findings on the incidence of CMS enforcement of EMTALA between 2005 and 2014. The team reported that there were 4,772 investigations, of which 2,118 (44%) resulted in citations of EMTALA deficiencies at 1,498 hospitals. The team also reported a declining trend in enforcement.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">The team also looked at the allegations by tag number in the EMTALA <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>. Most of the citations issued by CMS involve failure to follow hospital policies and procedures (73%). As to substantive requirement, failure to conduct an appropriate medical screening examinations was cited in 55% of the cases; other common citations were failure to provide stabilizing treatment (25%), transfers (28%), on-call performance (14%), and accepting hospital obligations (16%). As to administrative requirements, citations for the central log were cited in 25% of the cases.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-4"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	Reference:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-6">Terp et al., "Enforcement of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, 2005 to 2014," 69 Annals of Emergency Medicine, No. 2, February 2017 (pp. 155-162).</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>Does EMTALA provide for <a id="_idIndexMarker009"></a>whistleblower protection?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">EMTALA and California whistleblower protection laws are discussed in chapter 12, "Reporting Patient-Dumping Violations," under <a href="">G.&nbsp;"Can a hospital retaliate against a physician or staff member who reports an EMTALA or state anti-dumping law violation?," page&nbsp;12.3</a>.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>What is the scope of an EMTALA complaint survey?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idIndexMarker010"></a>A complaint survey must be conducted within five working days after receiving CMS authorization. All surveys are unannounced. The focus of the survey is on the initial allegation of a violation and the discovery of additional violations. The purposes of the survey are to:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-7">Ascertain whether a violation occurred, and if so, whether it constituted an immediate and serious threat to patient health and safety;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-7">Identify any patterns of violations at the hospital; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-7">Assess whether the hospital has policies and procedures to address the EMTALA obligations.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If the survey confirms that a violation occurred, the surveyors are directed to continue their investigation, with an emphasis on EMTALA compliance within the six-month period preceding the survey. If the survey confirms that a violation did not occur, the surveyors are directed to seek assurance that the hospitalâ€™s policies and procedures, physician certifications for transfer, and other actions are in compliance with the EMTALA obligations. The survey consists of the following tasks.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Entrance Conference</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">A brief entrance conference is conducted with the hospital chief executive officer (or his or her designee) and any other invited hospital staff to explain the nature of the allegation, the purpose of the investigation and the standards for the survey. The identities of the complainant and the patient are not to be disclosed in the absence of written consent.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a>Document Request</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The hospital is requested to provide the documents and information set forth in Appendix J, "Hospital Records Subject to EMTALA Enforcement Survey." These include central logs, policies and procedures, medical staff records, on-call rosters, personnel files, in-service records, quality improvement minutes, etc.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a>Patient Record Request</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Although a single occurrence may trigger an EMTALA survey, a sample of patient medical records must be reviewed in order to identify the presence of additional violations or a pattern of violations. Therefore, the surveyors are directed to select 20 to 50 patient records to review in detail; the sample size may be expanded as necessary to adequately investigate possible violations or patterns of violations.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The type of records reviewed will vary based on the nature of the complaint and the types of patients seeking emergency services. For example, an inappropriate transfer complaint will require the review of patients who were transferred by the hospital. If the review identifies multiple violations, the surveyors are directed to determine, if possible, whether the pattern of violations is related to diagnosis, race, color, insurance status, nationality or disability.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"></a>Further Review</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If one or more violations are identified from a review of the medical records, the surveyors are directed to obtain copies of the records for the cases of suspected violations. In addition, the surveyors will review documents pertaining to quality assuranc<span class="No-break">e/p</span>erformance improvement for the dedicated emergency department(s) and remedial actions taken in response to the violations. Corrective action taken before the survey will be documented by the surveyor and considered in the recommendations submitted to the CMS regional office. Additional information on the record review and documentation is discussed in chapter 3, "Medical Screening Examinations," and pages 9-11 of Appendix K, "Investigative Procedures for EMTALA Surveyors" (part of the <span class="Italic">State Operations Manual</span>).</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"></a>Expanded Scope of Survey</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If, during the survey of an accredited hospital, the surveyors identify a possible violation of the Medicare Conditions of Participation, the surveyors will seek authorization from the CMS regional office to expand the investigation. If the hospital is not accredited, the surveyors may expand the survey without prior contact with the CMS regional office.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"></a>Interviews</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">A key part of the survey is the interview of hospital staff and physicians. The guidance for surveyors states that the surveyor "may be able to gather a great deal of information from the admitting clerk in the emergency department, the nurses on shift at the time the individual sought treatment, and the Director of Quality Improvement in the hospital to name a few." The surveyors may also interview witnesses, ambulance personnel, the patient or his or her family members, or the personnel at a hospital that accepted or received the patient.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"></a>Exit Survey</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">At the end of the survey, the survey team will schedule an exit conference to review the scope of the investigation, the survey tasks, the requirements investigated and whether any Conditions of Participation were violated. The surveyors are directed not to advise the hospital whether a violation was confirmed because that determination is reserved for the CMS regional office. However, the surveyors are directed to inform the hospital staff of the consequences of a violation and the time frames to correct any violation that may be confirmed by the regional office.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The results of the survey are documented on the Statement of Deficiencies and Plan of Correction (Form CMS 2567), the same form used for validation surveys. The paperwork must be forwarded to the CMS regional office within prescribed time frames. A discussion of how the survey report should be prepared is discussed on pages 13-16 of Appendix K.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In addition to the survey team report, the CMS regional office is directed to request a <a id="_idIndexMarker011"></a>QIO review before terminating a hospitalâ€™s provider agreement for violations. The purpose of the QIO review is to determine:</p><ol>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">If a medical screening was appropriate (i.e., suitable for the presenting symptoms and conducted in a non-disparate fashion);</li>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">If an individual had an emergency medical condition;</li>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">In the case of a pregnant woman, whether there was inadequate time to effect a safe transfer prior to the delivery, or the transfer posed a threat to the health and safety of the woman or the unborn child;</li>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">If stabilizing treatment was appropriate within the capability of the hospital;</li>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">If a transfer was made with qualified personnel and transportation equipment;</li>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">If applicable, the on-call physicianâ€™s response time was reasonable; and</li>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">If a transfer was appropriate for the individual, including a determination that the medical benefits of the transfer outweighed the risks or the patient made an informed request for the transfer.</li>
						</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The QIO must be provided five days to conduct the review (this is often referred to as "The Five-Day Review"). The review by the QIO is not required if the delay would jeopardize the health and safety of patients.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">There is no time frame for the CMS regional office to accept, modify or reject the draft survey report. The "Investigative Procedures for EMTALA Surveyors" (part of the <span class="Italic">State Operations Manual</span>) strongly encourages the regional office to share information with the hospital (subject to applicable privacy laws).</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"></a>What are CMSâ€™s enforcement options if it confirms an EMTALA violation?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idIndexMarker012"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker013"></a>If CMS determines that a hospital has violated EMTALA, it has three options.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"></a>No Termination</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">CMS may advise the hospital of the violation, but take no further enforcement action if there have been no further violations. This course of action may be taken if the hospital and its medical staff identified the violation and implemented appropriate corrective action before the EMTALA enforcement survey.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"></a>90-Day Termination</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">CMS may terminate the hospitalâ€™s provider agreement on a 90-day notice if it determines that the violation is a threat to patient health and safety. In the "Investigative Procedures for EMTALA Surveyors" (part of the <span class="Italic">State Operations Manual</span>), the following examples are provided as guidance to the CMS regional offices of the types of administrative errors for which a 90-day termination notice may be indicated:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-7">A transfer was appropriate, but the physician certification form was not signed or dated by the physician;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-7">An appropriate, functioning central log was not fully completed on a particular day; or</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-7">A hospital policy was missing at the time of the survey, but had been implemented by the hospital.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"></a>23-Day Termination</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">CMS may terminate the hospitalâ€™s provider agreement on a 23-day notice if it determines that the violation constitutes imminent jeopardy to patient health and safety. The following examples are provided as guidance to the CMS regional offices as to the types of cases for which a 23-day termination notice may be indicated:</p><ol>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">Failing to provide necessary stabilizing treatment;</li>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Failing to respond appropriately while acting as an on-call physician;</li>

						</ol></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"></a>How should a hospital respond to a notice of termination?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">If CMS determines that a hospital has violated EMTALA, the hospital will receive a transmittal letter and a Statement of Deficiencies (Form CMS 2567) from the CMS regional office.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"></a>The Transmittal Letter</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">The transmittal letter advises the hospital whether CMS intends to seek termination of the hospitalâ€™s Medicare provider agreement on a 23- or 90-day notice. The notice also states when the plan of correction must be submitted to CMS and the date on which CMS will publish the notice of termination in the local newspaper if an acceptable plan of correction has not been submitted to CMS in a timely manner.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"></a>The <a id="_idIndexMarker014"></a>Statement of Deficiencies</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">The Statement of Deficiencies will cite the EMTALA tag numbers (e.g., A-240<span class="No-break">9/C</span>-2409 for an inappropriate transfer) identified in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> for each EMTALA regulation for which the hospital is not in compliance. The Statement of Deficiencies will include the text of the cited regulation, the general nature of the noncompliance (such as "the hospital failed to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination") and recite the facts for each violation, including specific patient medical records, hospital practices or information obtained from staff interviews as evidence of alleged violations of EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"></a>EMTALA Compliance Team</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">Upon receipt of the transmittal letter containing the notice of termination and the Statement of Deficiencies, the hospital should immediately assemble an EMTALA compliance team and establish a timetable for preparing the plan of correction. The compliance team should include, at a minimum, one or more members of the executive staff, department heads, medical directors, the compliance officer, risk management and the quality improvement director. As appropriate, the hospital should add other staff members and legal counsel to provide the necessary expertise for developing and implementing an effective plan of correction. The EMTALA compliance team should be responsible for developing, implementing and overseeing the plan of correction, reviewing EMTALA compliance in other hospital departments and evaluating cases cited in the Statement of Deficiencies for possible civil money penalties or potential litigation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker015"></a>Plan of Correction</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">A hospital must submit a credible and effective plan of correction in order for CMS to withdraw the termination action. The hospital team should review the Statement of Deficiencies, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, applicable department and quality management policies, existing hospital practices and in-service education programs. Hospital staff should be interviewed if there are gaps in the patient medical record or other facts that are pertinent to the alleged violation. The hospital should consider describing in a transmittal letter to CMS or the plan of correction the process followed to bring the hospital into compliance with EMTALA (especially if responding to a 23-day notice of termination).</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">The plan of correction should include the following three elements.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-4 _idGenParaOverride-4">Corrective Action</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">For each deficiency cited by CMS, the plan should identify the corrective action implemented to remedy the deficiency. The action may require the development of new policies and procedures, the revision of existing policies and procedures or other changes in hospital practices that are necessary to bring the hospital into compliance.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">For each corrective action taken by the hospital, the plan of correction must state the specific actions to correct the deficiency, the timetable for implementing the action, the performance measures to ensure compliance and the staff person responsible for overseeing compliance. To the extent feasible, the corrective action should be implemented prior to the submission of the plan of correction.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-4 _idGenParaOverride-4">In-Service Education</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">As discussed in chapter 15, "Quality Improvement and Risk Management," in-service education is the key to effective EMTALA compliance. It is essential that all affected hospital staff are aware of the changes in policies and practices adopted by the hospital in response to the statement of deficiencies. During the re-survey of the hospital to verify compliance with the plan of correction, the surveyors are likely to question staff as to their understanding of the new policies and practices. The hospital should maintain documentation of the in-service education programs, including copies of the sign-in sheets and the education materials distributed to staff as part of the in-service education plan.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-4 _idGenParaOverride-4">Quality Improvement</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">The hospital must adopt effective quality management practices and survey tools in order to ensure that the hospital complies with the plan of correction and that the deficiencies will not be repeated. Recommendations for monitoring EMTALA compliance are provided in chapter 15, "Quality Improvement and Risk Management." The quality improvement program adopted in response to the statement of deficiencies should be described in the plan of correction. The program should be implemented concurrent with the submission of the plan of correction, and the results should be available for review during the re-survey.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"></a>Review of Hospital Compliance with EMTALA</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">In addition to preparing the plan of correction, the team should review EMTALA compliance in areas that were not the focus of the original survey (for example, patient transfers, if the survey focus was on medical screening) or in other locations of the hospital that were not visited by the surveyors at the time of the original survey.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">Because the scope of the re-survey is not limited to the issues cited in the Statement of Deficiencies, the surveyors may visit other departments providing emergency services. For example, if the original survey was limited to the emergency department, the surveyors may visit labor and delivery or other departments during the re-survey to verify compliance with EMTALA. The team should review policies and practices in other departments, implement changes in the policies and practices as necessary, initiate in-service education and implement quality improvement activities.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"></a>Review of Cases</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">The team should also oversee the review of the medical records copied by the surveyors (a list will usually be provided to the hospital) to determine potential liability for civil money penalties or litigation. In accordance with the "Investigative Procedures for EMTALA Surveyors" (part of the <span class="Italic">State Operations Manual</span>), some or all of the medical records will be forwarded by CMS to the QIO for analysis of potential EMTALA violations and quality of care issues. As discussed later in this chapter, the preliminary QIO findings are forwarded to the hospital for review and comment. The final QIO report is forwarded by CMS to the OIG for consideration of the imposition of civil money penalties.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">The review of the medical records should be performed to determine whether the description of each case in the Statement of Deficiencies is accurate and whether the entire medical record was copied for the surveyors. In some cases, the surveyors receive only a portion of a record, which may result in only a partial understanding of the case. If a medical record reflects poor documentation, the team should attempt to fill in the gaps with supplementary documentation. If the medical record itself requires revision, this should be done in an appropriate manner in accordance with hospital policy. If the team identifies medical records that may pose liability for civil money penalties or potential litigation, the cases should be reported to risk management. The hospital, under the direction of legal counsel, should continue to compile any information and documentation that is available to defend the hospitalâ€™s actions in the event that it later becomes necessary.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"></a>Does submitting a plan of correction imply that a hospital admits it violated EMTALA?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">No. The submission of a plan of correction by a hospital to address allegations of noncompliance with EMTALA is not interpreted as an admission by the hospital of an EMTALA violation. Many hospitals include a sentence at the beginning of the plan of correction that the submission of the plan of correction does not constitute an admission or agreement of the facts or conclusions contained in the Statement of Deficiencies.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"></a>What can the hospital do if it disagrees with the survey findings?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">In some cases, the hospital may disagree that its actions constitute a violation of EMTALA, or believe that the survey team misinterpreted the EMTALA obligations or accepted industry guidelines and practices. Although submitting a plan of correction is not admission of a violation, the hospital may feel that it should not have been cited at all.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">The "Investigative Procedures for EMTALA Surveyors" (Appendix K) provide that the "hospital has the opportunity to present evidence to CMS that it believes demonstrates its compliance and the opportunity to comment on evidence CMS believes demonstrates the hospitalâ€™s noncompliance." For example, the hospital may be able to present its case to CMS between the exit conference and the issuance of a Statement of Deficiencies. In a very rare case, the hospital may be able to convince CMS to withdraw a Statement of Deficiencies after it is issued.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">However, CMS may reject a plan of correction that attacks the findings in the Statement of Deficiencies, without a stated plan for correcting the alleged deficiencies cited in the survey. Even if the plan of correction includes compliance actions, CMS may still request that the hospital rewrite the plan of correction to delete the parts of the plan that attack the findings.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">If a hospital desires to dispute the findings of the survey, it needs to move quickly to compile its evidence of compliance and then present its case to CMS. The hospital should consult with physicians, legal counsel and others who may assist in confirming whether its actions were appropriate or inappropriate under EMTALA. A request should be made to CMS for copies of the five-day reviews conducted by the QIO to evaluate the analysis presented to CMS.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">Despite convictions that the hospital met its obligations, the hospital should expect that it will have an uphill battle to reverse one or more alleged deficiencies in the absence of obvious mistakes by the survey team.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"></a>What is the role of the <a id="_idIndexMarker016"></a>QIO in the EMTALA enforcement process?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Following the completion of the EMTALA survey process, including one or more re-surveys, CMS will usually refer one or more cases from the EMTALA surveys to the QIO for review. The QIO review, typically referred to as the "60-day review," is an opportunity for the hospital and physicians to discuss the cases selected by CMS for QIO review. The QIO is required to review the facts of each case, as well as comment on quality concerns. However, the QIO does not determine whether a hospital or physician violated the EMTALA obligations; that determination is the responsibility of CMS and the OIG.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The QIO 60-day review is performed as part of the EMTALA sanctions process. In considering sanctions, the OIG must request that the QIO assess whether a patient had an emergency medical condition (EMC) that was not stabilized, in addition to other medical issues. Except where delay would jeopardize health or safety or there is no medical issue to review, OIG must request a QIO review before terminating or suspending a provider, or imposing civil money penalties.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> One QIO organization has commented that a number of hospitals have not responded to the QIO review. Hospitals should consider the QIO review an essential part of the OIG process. From the viewpoint of the OIG, ignoring the QIO notice indicates a failure to take seriously the review process and the EMTALA obligations. Therefore, the failure to respond to the QIO review may result in higher than anticipated demands from the OIG for civil penalties or settlement amounts.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The QIO process described below follows chapter 9 of the <span class="Italic">Quality Improvement Organization Manual</span>, which was revised by CMS in 2016.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"></a>Notice</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The QIO begins the process by providing written notice of the 60-day review to the responsible physician and hospital. The notice includes:</p><ol>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The names of the patient or patients;</li>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The date(s) of the alleged violation;</li>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">An invitation to meet by telephone or in person and to submit additional information within 30 days; and</li>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">A copy of the regulations.</li>
						</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The notice of the 60-day review that is typically mailed by the QIO does not include copies of the completed five-day reviews that were performed by the QIO prior to the issuance by CMS of the Statement of Deficiencies. If the hospital has not requested the five-day reviews before receiving the QIO notice, it should immediately contact CMS for copies of the reviews.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The QIO physician reviewer uses an EMTALA Physician Review Worksheet <span class="Italic">(see Appendix W)</span> to evaluate each case that is referred to the QIO (the worksheet for the 60-day review is the same form that is used for the five-day review). This worksheet includes each element of the EMTALA obligations. The worksheet is in the form of questions, with a checkbox (usually with "yes," "no" and "not applicable") for each element and space for comments by the reviewing physician. Items 14 and 15 address whether there were inappropriate delays in the medical screening or stabilizing treatment and whether there were any quality of care issues. At the end of the worksheet (Item 16), the physician reviewer will summarize the overall findings. The worksheet includes an admonition that the reviewer should not state whether the actions of the hospital or the physician violated EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The QIO evaluation is usually written by a physician in the same specialty as the responsible physician (for example, an emergency physician will review alleged violations of EMTALA for failure to provide an adequate medical screening in the emergency department). In some cases, the QIO may assign the case to a physician in a different specialty, such as a psychiatrist to review a psychiatric assessment performed by an emergency physician. If this occurs, the hospital or responsible physician should request the QIO to assign a physician in the same specialty as the treating physician.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"></a>Reply to the Notice</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The hospital or physician must reply to the QIO notice for the 60-day review in a timely manner in order to schedule a meeting or submit a written response for each case evaluated by the reviewing physician. The meeting or written response usually must be completed within 30 days from receipt of the QIO notice.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In preparing for a meeting or drafting the response, the hospital should consider that the QIO review is part of the OIG process. The hospital should include both clinical analysis and any applicable legal arguments that respond to the reviewerâ€™s concerns and findings. As appropriate, the response should address each of the EMTALA elements considered by the reviewer to be applicable to the patientâ€™s case.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The hospital or physician should also consider the limited information that may have been given to the QIO. In most cases, the QIO reviewer has received a copy of the patient medical records for the cases, and some information or notes compiled by the surveyors; the QIO does not in all cases have a copy of the survey report (i.e., Statement of Deficiencies) or the plan of correction.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The 60-day review affords the hospital or physician an opportunity to submit additional information and documents (including, as appropriate, declarations from physicians and nurses, tapes or films, or other information that may have not been available or requested at the time of the on-site survey) that provide a more complete picture to the reviewer of the cases.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> If the cases reviewed by the QIO involve emergency department saturation or capacity constraints, the hospital should submit documentation of the emergency department census (hour-by-hour if available), acuity of patients held in the emergency department (especially trauma cases and patients waiting for an inpatient bed), waiting times and other information that provide greater context to circumstances existing at the time of the incidents that were cited by CMS in the Statement of Deficiencies.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"></a>The QIO Meeting</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The QIO must provide written notice to an affected hospital or physician of the opportunity to schedule a telephonic or face-to-face meeting. The QIO is directed to inform the OIG through the appropriate CMS Regional Office of the time and date of the meeting, and whether the hospital or physician declines the opportunity to meet with the QIO. The meeting is an informal forum for discussion of the EMTALA case(s); it is not an adversarial hearing governed by rules of evidence, cross-examination of witnesses or other legal rules.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The primary purpose of the meeting is for the physician an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r hospital to present their views on the case. Past experience with QIO meetings indicates that the QIO personnel prefer that one or more physicians present the hospitalâ€™s view of the case(s). While the hospital and physicians may have legal counsel present, it is optional for the QIO to have legal counsel at the meeting. The QIO may limit the scope, extent and manner of any questioning by legal counsel. The physician or hospital may present expert testimony in written or oral form, although the QIO may reasonably limit the number of witnesses and the length of irrelevant or repetitive testimony. The presenting hospital or physician should not expect the QIO or a physician reviewer to provide a clinical opinion about the case during the meeting.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The QIO must arrange for a recording of the meeting, but it is not required to produce a transcript of the recording unless requested by the CMS Regional Office or the OIG.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">After the completion of the meeting, the QIO is not required to consider additional information from the hospital or physician that was not submitted at the meeting, unless the QIO requests the information before the end of the meeting. Under CMS Guidelines, the time frame to submit any additional information after the meeting is five days.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Hospitals should not consider the 60-day review as an unnecessary burden. It may be an opportunity to limit the likelihood or amount of civil money penalties. Some pointers for preparing for the meeting include the following:</p><ol>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">Ensure that the QIO notice is immediately referred to the hospital representative designated as the point person for managing the EMTALA review process. The notice should also be forwarded to legal counsel as appropriate. The QIO notice is typically sent to the hospital chief executive officer. If the importance or timeliness of the QIO notice is not immediately apparent, it may result in either scrambling to arrange and prepare for the meeting or to submit a written response within the 30- day period from the receipt of the QIO notice.</li>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">After reviewing the QIO notice and identifying the cases selected for review, the hospital should identify the key persons who should participate in the meeting and their availability. While participation of legal counsel is not required for the meeting, hospitals should consult their in-house or outside legal counsel with respect to the QIO notice and the meeting since the 60-day review may be preparatory to a decision by CMS to refer one or more cases to the OIG for consideration of civil money penalties.</li>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">As soon as possible, the hospital should contact the QIO representative identified in the QIO notice to arrange a date for the meeting.</li>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">As noted above, the hospital should contact CMS to obtain the five-day reviews of the cases selected for the meeting in order to determine the issues identified by the QIO in its prior review of the cases.</li>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The hospitalâ€™s team should review the facts of the cases, including any internal reviews of the cases, or interviews with physicians or hospital staff regarding the facts or circumstances of the cases. If the medical record is incomplete, an effort should be made to identify the missing information that may be pertinent to the presentation of the case at the QIO meeting.</li>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The hospitalâ€™s team should identify any additional information that the reviewer may not have received in conducting the five-day review (for example, missing parts of the medical record).</li>
						</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">At the time the hospital is scheduling the meeting for the 60-day review, a representative of the hospital should request a QIO representative to identify the documents relating to each case, including the contents of the patient medical record. Even if the QIO cannot release copies of the documents, it may be possible to determine whether the records are complete.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If the timing of the medical screening exam or other emergency services is an issue, the hospital should review the emergency department census and other relevant information for the date of service.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The hospital should also review whether there are documents or information that the surveyors may not have reviewed or taken in connection with the survey. For example, in a case involving a patient who died in the emergency waiting room while waiting to be seen, a hospital submitted to the QIO a videotape of the waiting room that included the patient up to the point of death.</p><ol>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">After compiling all available information, the hospitalâ€™s team should consider its approach to each case, including discussion of unusual facts or circumstances related to the case, the clinical analysis of the care and treatment provided to each patient, and any legal arguments.</li>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The hospital should identify a member of the management team to introduce the physicians and staff who will participate in the meeting. It may be helpful for the member of the management team to make a brief (5-10 minute) presentation at the meeting to provide an overview of the hospital and its services, the characteristics of its service area, the demographics of the patient population (especially emergency patients), emergency department volume and other relevant data, and any other information that may be helpful to provide a picture of the hospital and its role in the community.</li>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Each case selected for QIO review should be presented by a physician, such as the chief medical officer, director of quality, director of the emergency department, etc. While not required, it is usually helpful to script each case presentation in relevant time sequence, beginning with the patientâ€™s arrival and continuing to the patientâ€™s departure or other disposition. The case presentation should be complete to make sure that all relevant facts and circumstances of the cases are presented "on the record." As may be applicable, this includes pre-arrival information, presenting condition and complaint, triage, the medical screening, the continuing course of care, diagnostic and other testing, the clinical decision making about the case and the patientâ€™s disposition.</li>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">There is no requirement that the physician or staff who were involved with the cases must participate in the QIO meeting.</li>
						</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Practice Tip:</span> The hospital should not assume that the QIO has a complete copy of the patient medical records, even if the hospital has provided the entire medical record to the EMTALA survey team.<br><br><span class="CharOverride-2">Case Example:</span> In a QIO 60-day review regarding the appropriateness of a medical screening examination, QIO reported at the meeting that it did not have a copy of the emergency department physicianâ€™s dictated patient report, even though the report had been provided to the survey team and quoted in the Statement of Deficiencies issued by CMS.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"></a>Additional Information</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If the meeting with the QIO reveals additional information that was not reviewed by the QIO or is helpful to the hospitalâ€™s case, the hospital should request the opportunity to submit the additional information after the meeting.

The court found that the QIO review was a mandatory obligation of the OIG, and that the failure to provide the review has the potential to prejudice the hospital under investigation. However, the court upheld the Departmental Appeals Board decision, stating that it excluded the QIOâ€™s analysis of the case in its consideration of the hospitalâ€™s appeal.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References">QIO Manual, Chapter 9 â€“ Sanction, EMTALA, Fraud and Abuse (Feb. 12, 2016)</p></li></ol></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"></a>Civil Sanctions<ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"></a>How are civil sanctions imposed by <a id="_idIndexMarker018"></a>OIG?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">Upon confirmation of an EMTALA violation, OIG may exercise its discretion to impose civil money penalties against a hospital or physician found to have violated EMTALA. In the typical case, OIG will notify the hospital or physician of the alleged violations, request the submission of additional information to respond to the allegations and invite settlement discussions.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">If the hospital or physician disputes the allegations, or is unable to settle the matter with the OIG, the case may be submitted for a hearing before an administrative law judge of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and ultimately appealed to the federal courts. In the <span class="Italic">St. Anthony Hospital</span> case (discussed in chapter 7, "Obligations of Receiving Hospitals"), the appeals court stated that a hospital must "negligently" violate EMTALA in order to support the imposition of civil money penalties.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"></a>Are settlement agreements with the OIG available to the public?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">Once executed, a settlement agreement is subject to public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.

The IRS has also requested information on tax-exempt hospitals that have been sanctioned under EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">Within the past few years, OCR has requested information and documents from Hill-Burton hospitals that receive a Statement of Deficiencies from CMS. The typical OCR letter requests policies and procedures for emergency services, patient transfers, hospital admissions, ambulatory clinics and patient payment practices (such as deposits and alternative arrangements). The letter also requests the hospital to describe its service area, state whether the hospital participates in Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payer programs, report whether the hospital places limits on its services to patients and confirm the locations where the hospital has posted the Hill-Burton community service notices. OCR usually gives the hospital 30 days to respond to the request for documents and information.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker019"></a>What are the sanctions under state laws for patient-dumping?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">Some states have adopted penalties for violation of state anti-dumping laws. For example, under California law, hospitals are subject to a civil money penalty of up to $25,000 per violation, and possible suspension or loss of an emergency medical services permit. Hospitals are regulated by CDPH, but any violation by a hospital that is owned and operated by a licensed health care service plan (such as Kaiser) with respect to a plan member must be referred to the Department of Managed Health Care for enforcement.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-4">Physicians are subject to a civil money penalty of up to $5,000 per violation, with credit for fines paid to the federal government under EMTALA. Enforcement actions against physicians are the responsibility of the Medical Board of California. The Board may impose a fine if it finds that:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-7">The violation was knowing or willful;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-7">The violation was reasonably likely to result in a medical hazard; or</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-7">There were repeated violations.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Personnel who knowingly or intentionally violate California law are also subject to misdemeanor penalties brought by the district attorney.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The state fines may not duplicate federal fines. The state is required to credit a hospital or a physician for amounts paid as federal fines. The imposition of civil money fines may be appealed administratively (including an informal conference). If contested, the attorney general may bring action to enforce fines, with the burden of proof on the state to prove the violation and the appropriateness of the fine. If fines are dismissed or reduced, the administrative records must reflect the dismissal or reduction. In lieu of judicial review, the dispute may be submitted to arbitration.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"></a>Can a violation of state law also constitute "immediate jeopardy" and be grounds for licensing sanctions?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Yes. If in the course of an EMTALA or state survey, the surveyors identify practices, actions or errors that constitute "immediate jeopardy" under California law, CDPH may initiate penalties that are permitted under the California Health and Safety Code. Under California law, "immediate jeopardy" is defined as "a situation in which the licenseeâ€™s noncompliance with one or more requirements of licensure has caused, or is likely to cause, serious injury or death to the patient."</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Examples of immediate jeopardy sanctions that have been issued for emergency service obligations include the failure to maintain an appropriate roster of on-call physicians, the failure to ensure an appropriate and readily accessible supply of emergency drugs, and medication errors that may constitute an "adverse event."</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Further information on administrative penalties for incidents constituting "immediate jeopardy" can be found in CHAâ€™s <span class="Italic">California Hospital Survey Manual</span>.

Additionally, any facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospitalâ€™s violation of EMTALA can obtain damages and equitable relief under applicable state law. No private enforcement action may be brought under EMTALA more than two years after the date of the violation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Under California law, persons suffering personal harm and facilities suffering financial loss from violations of state statute<span class="No-break">s/r</span>egulations may seek civil action, including damages, reasonable attorney fees and other appropriate relief. The attorney general or district attorney may also bring an action to enforce state emergency service laws.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="All-Caps-Bold">Note:</span> Since the enactment of EMTALA, there have been hundreds of reported decisions in EMTALA actions brought by patients against hospitals. The following is an overview of the types of judicial decisions interpreting EMTALA in these civil actions. This summary is intended to provide a sampling of EMTALA cases; it is not a comprehensive review or listing of EMTALA decisions.</p></li>
							<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor003"></a>Private Actions<ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"></a>A Patient May Bring an EMTALA Action Against a Hospital, Not Against Physicians<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The language and legislative history of EMTALA show that the statute was not intended to provide a private cause of action against physicians. However, many federal EMTALA claims also include state malpractice claims against the physicians involved. The federal courts have shown a willingness to retain jurisdiction of such claims, even when the EMTALA claim has been dismissed.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>Private Actions Against Public Hospitals<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">EMTALA allows any individual who suffers personal harm as a direct result of a violation to initiate a civil action against the hospital for damages (to the degree available under the laws of the state) an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r equitable relief. However, several district court cases and a Sixth Circuit case dismissed EMTALA claims brought by patients against public hospitals. These courts have concluded that in EMTALA, Congress did not convey a clear intent to eliminate a stateâ€™s ability to determine which types of cases can be brought against it (or against political subdivisions of the state, such as counties or districts that operate hospitals) in its courts. If a state voluntarily waives its immunity from EMTALA lawsuits, or does not raise immunity claims in response to a private action against it, an individual can maintain an EMTALA action for money damages against a public hospital.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a>Third-Party Right of Action Against a Hospital<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The EMTALA statute provides that "any individual" who suffers personal harm as a direct result of a violation may initiate a civil action against the hospital. In a groundbreaking decision, the Sixth Circuit recently interpreted "any individual" expansively, to include not just patients or their representatives, but also third parties who suffer personal harm as a direct result of a hospitalâ€™s failure to screen or stabilize a patient as required under EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In <span class="Italic">Moses v. Providence Hospital and Medical Ctrs.</span>, 561 F.3d 573 (6th Cir. 2009), the estate of Marie Moses-Irons brought an action for damages alleging that the hospital had violated EMTALA in discharging Moses-Ironsâ€™ husband ten days before he murdered her. On Dec. 13, 2002, Moses-Irons took her estranged husband to the emergency room due to physical and psychiatric symptoms including hallucinations, delusions and threatening behavior that she reported to emergency room staff had made her fear for her safety. Her husband was admitted as an inpatient, but was not transferred to the hospitalâ€™s psychiatric unit despite physician documentation requesting such transfer. Howard was discharged on Dec. 19, 2002 and murdered Moses-Irons ten days later.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The district court dismissed the action in 2007 without addressing the issue of whether Moses-Irons had standing to sue. However, the Sixth Circuit squarely addressed the issue, holding that the plain language of EMTALA allows any individual, not just a patient, to sue after sustaining personal harm as a direct result of a hospitalâ€™s EMTALA violation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The Moses decision marks the first time a federal court has addressed whether non-patients have standing to sue for personal harm under EMTALA. It remains to be seen whether other federal courts will find the decision in the Moses case persuasive. As noted later in this chapter, the court rejected the hospitalâ€™s argument that EMTALA did not apply since the husband was admitted as an inpatient; the Sixth Circuit has held in several cases that EMTALA applies to the discharge of inpatients who first presented to the emergency department.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>Procedural Rules and Damages<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>Limitations on Damages</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">A number of federal and state courts have held that state limits on damage recovery for personal injury or malpractice actions apply to EMTALA damages. In <span class="Italic">Barris v. County of Los Angeles</span> (20 Cal.4th 101 (1999)), the California Supreme Court held that the limitations on recovery for noneconomic damages prescribed by the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act (MICRA) of 1975 apply to certain EMTALA claims. The court stated in a footnote to the case that it was limiting its conclusion to claims under EMTALA for failure to provide necessary stabilizing treatment. The court noted that it did not consider whether the MICRA limits apply to failure to provide an appropriate medical screening examination since the plaintiffâ€™s EMTALA screening claim was dismissed and not an issue before the court.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Discovery of <a id="_idIndexMarker001"></a>Peer Review Records</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">California Evidence Code Section 1157 protects from discovery in civil litigation (such as malpractices cases) the records and proceedings of peer review bodies (including hospital medical staff). As a state rule of evidence, Section 1157 is not always given full effect in federal court. In <span class="Italic">Burrows v. Redbud Community Hospital</span> (187 F.R.D. 606 (1998)), the plaintiff sought to obtain access to peer review records. The California district court declined to apply Section 1157 to the discovery request, based on a prior ruling permitting discovery in a California antitrust case, and a finding that the absolute protection of Section 1157 was inconsistent with the flexibility of federal privilege law.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a>Injunctive Relief</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">A patient may bring an action under EMTALA for injunctive relief against a hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker002"></a>Termination of Medicare Provider Status</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">EMTALA does not authorize private plaintiffs to initiate a civil action to terminate a hospitalâ€™s Medicare provider agreement.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"></a>Punitive Damages</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Recovery of damages may include punitive damages if permitted under state law.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"></a>Preemption</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">State and local laws are not preempted, except to the extent that a requirement directly conflicts with EMTALA.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"></a>Standard of Proof<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In January 1999, the U.S. Supreme Court (524 U.S. 249) reversed a Kentucky case in which the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that EMTALA requires showing an improper motive in order for damages to be recovered for an EMTALA violation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In <span class="Italic">Roberts v. Galen of Virginia, Inc.</span>, the patient was admitted to the then Humana Hospital â€” University of Louisville for injuries resulting from being hit by a truck. Following a two-month stay, the patient was discharged to a nursing facility, where her condition significantly deteriorated. Although the hospital social worker who placed the patient knew that the patient was uninsured, the resident who discharged the patient was unaware of the patientâ€™s financial condition. The patientâ€™s guardian brought an action alleging that the hospital failed to comply with EMTALA by discharging the patient in an unstabilized condition, among other grounds.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The district court ruled in favor of the hospital, finding that the plaintiff had not proven that the patient was medically unstable or that the transfer order was caused by an improper motive. The Sixth Circuit, in affirming the district court decision, held that a patient must demonstrate an improper motive beyond financial considerations in order to maintain a cause of action under EMTALA. As examples of an "improper motive," the court cited race, sex, politics, occupation, education, personal prejudice, drunkenness and spite.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The <span class="Italic">Roberts</span> case was the first and only EMTALA case to be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court. In a unanimous opinion, the court held that a plaintiff does not have to demonstrate an improper motive by a provider in order to recover damages under EMTALA for failure to provide further examination and treatment to stabilize an emergency medical condition prior to discharge or transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">This decision generally follows the view of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) that motive is not a relevant consideration in determining whether a physician or hospital violated EMTALA. However, an improper motive may increase the amount of civil money penalties assessed against a provider and, in particularly egregious or repeated cases, the possibility of an action to seek exclusion of the provider from the Medicare program.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 ParaOverride-4"><span class="CharOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"></a>Application to Hospital Inpatients</span><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text ParaOverride-2"><span class="CharOverride-4">In </span><span class="Italic CharOverride-4">Roberts</span><span class="CharOverride-4">, the Sixth Circuit (187 F.3d 637) noted in a footnote a prior decision of the same circuit (</span><span class="Italic CharOverride-4">Thornton v. Southwest Detroit Hosp.</span><span class="CharOverride-4">, discussed on </span><a href="EMTALA_Chap14_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor022" data-href="_idTextAnchor022"><span class="CharOverride-4"></span></a><span class="CharOverride-4">) holding that EMTALA applies to the transfer or discharge of an inpatient. Although the inpatient issue was argued before the court, the decision did not address the issue. At the time that the Supreme Court considered the </span><span class="Italic CharOverride-4">Roberts</span><span class="CharOverride-4"> case, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals had applied EMTALA to inpatients in both </span><span class="Italic CharOverride-4">Roberts</span><span class="CharOverride-4"> and </span><span class="Italic CharOverride-4">Thornton</span><span class="CharOverride-4">; however, the Fourth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals had declined to apply EMTALA to other cases involving inpatients. The Supreme Court declined to address the inpatient question since it was able to decide the case on narrower grounds.</span></p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text ParaOverride-2"><span class="CharOverride-4">Although EMTALA clearly applies to patients presenting to a dedicated emergency department, the statuteâ€™s applicability to inpatients is not as obvious. The courts that have addressed the inpatient issue have reached different interpretations of the following two relevant subsections in the statute:</span></p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-4">Subsection (a) of EMTALA specifies that any individual who comes to the emergency department is entitled to a medical screening exam to determine whether an emergency medical condition (EMC) exists.</span></li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-4">Subsection (b) of EMTALA requires the provision of further examination and stabilizing treatment to any emergent patient who comes to a hospital.</span></li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text ParaOverride-5"><span class="CharOverride-4">The difference between the references to "emergency department" in subsection (a), and to "hospital" in subsection (b), has been explored by the courts in determining whether they are interdependent or independent.</span></p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text ParaOverride-5"><span class="CharOverride-4">By construing each subsection of the statute in conjunction with the other, the Fourth and Ninth Circuits limited the scope of EMTALA to patients who received initial stabilizing care by the hospital. According to these circuits, the statuteâ€™s stabilization requirements in subsection (b) apply to patients who have been determined under subsection (a) to have an EMC; therefore, applying the law to hospital inpatients would erroneously extend EMTALAâ€™s scope.</span></p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text ParaOverride-5"><span class="CharOverride-4">The First and Sixth Circuits, however, have read these two subsections independently. These circuits have applied the EMTALA obligations to inpatients with an EMC. According to these circuits, EMTALA should apply to all patients suffering from an EMC because the problem of patient dumping is not limited to the emergency room.</span></p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 ParaOverride-7"><span class="CharOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"></a>Decisions Refusing to Apply EMTALA to Inpatients</span><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 ParaOverride-6"><span class="CharOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"></a></span><span class="CharOverride-3"><a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a></span><span class="CharOverride-4">James v. Sunrise Hosp., 86 F.3d 885 (9th Cir. 1996)</span></p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text ParaOverride-2"><span class="CharOverride-4">In James, the plaintiff entered the hospital with acute renal failure. A week later, the hospital discharged her despite her complaints about pain and numbness, a weak pulse and discoloration that had developed since receiving a synthetic graft in her arm when she came to the hospital. The plaintiffâ€™s hand subsequently had to be amputated. The plaintiff sued the hospital under subsection (c) of EMTALA, claiming that she was at the hospital with an EMC and was not stabilized before discharge.</span></p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text ParaOverride-2"><span class="CharOverride-4">The Ninth Circuit held that the case should be dismissed for failure to state a claim under EMTALA, determining that each subsection of EMTALA must be read in conjunction with the </span>others. The court concluded that the transfe<span class="No-break">r/d</span>ischarge obligations in subsection (c) of the EMTALA statute apply only to individuals who first presented to the emergency department (i.e., subsection (a)). Since subsection (c)(iii) of EMTALA requires a qualified professional to certify a transfer when a physician is not present in the emergency department, the court reasoned that the transfer obligations in subsection (c) must apply only to emergency room transfers. "It is impossible to think of a good reason why Congress would condition some subsection (c) transfer provisions on whether a physician â€˜is not physically present in the emergency departmentâ€™ unless it meant to be speaking in subsection (c) about decisions to be made in the emergency room." Since the plaintiff was not in the emergency room when she was discharged from the hospital, the court refused to apply EMTALAâ€™s transfer obligations to her discharge.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"></a>Bryant v. Adventist Health System West, 289 F.3d 1162 (9th Cir. 2002)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In <span class="Italic">Bryant</span>, the patient presented to the emergency department with a fever and chest pain. The emergency physician examined the patient, ordered tests, and discharged the patient with instructions to return the following day for further diagnosis and treatment. The following day, the hospital called the patientâ€™s family and requested that the patient return to the hospital immediately because of a lung abscess. The patient was seen in the emergency department, admitted as an inpatient, and transferred three days later to a hospital with a higher level of care. Following the death of the patient, the family sued the hospital, claiming a failure by the hospital to detect an EMC and to stabilize that condition as both an emergency patient and an inpatient.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Based on the medical screening and stabilization standard discussed on <a href="EMTALA_Chap14_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor033" data-href="_idTextAnchor033"></a> in connection with the <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> decision, the court upheld the district courtâ€™s determination that the hospital did not violate EMTALA on the initial visit to the emergency department. With respect to the alleged failure to provide stabilizing treatment during the inpatient stay, the court, after reviewing the <span class="Italic">Thornton</span> and <span class="Italic">Bryan</span> cases (discussed below), determined that EMTALA does not apply to inpatients unless the patient is admitted as a subterfuge to avoid the EMTALA requirements.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"></a>Bryan v. Rectors &amp; Visitors of the Univ. of Virginia, 95 F.3d 349 (4th Cir. 1996)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In <span class="Italic">Bryan</span>, the patient was admitted to the hospital in emergency respiratory distress. After 12 days of treating the patient, the hospital determined it would not make further efforts to prevent her death, despite the familyâ€™s wishes to the contrary. Eight days later, when the patient faced a life-threatening heart attack, the hospital took no action and the patient died. The plaintiff sued the University of Virginia, claiming that the universityâ€™s hospital failed to stabilize the patient as required under EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The Fourth Circuit upheld the district courtâ€™s dismissal of the plaintiffâ€™s complaint for failure to state a claim under EMTALA. The court explained that "[t]he stabilization requirement was intended to regulate the hospitalâ€™s care of the patient only in the immediate aftermath of the act of admitting her for emergency treatment." The court pointed out that professional standards of care and state medical malpractice laws govern the adequacy of care for a patient once EMTALAâ€™s limited purpose is served, and the patient is beyond initial emergency admission and stabilization. The court added, "everyone agrees EMTALA was not intended to preempt [malpractice law]." Therefore, although it did not address the issue specifically, the courtâ€™s reasoning suggests that EMTALA does not impose a continuing obligation to provide stabilizing care to inpatients during the entirety of their stay in the hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"></a>Baxter v.

Approximately two weeks after admission, the patientâ€™s wife, after consultation with the treating physician, agreed to the termination of the patientâ€™s dialysis due to difficulties in the procedure. The patient remained in the hospital for another week, at which time his wife was advised that the hospital would no longer assume payment for her husbandâ€™s care. Although the hospital did not require the patient to leave, his wife consented to his transfer to a nursing facility within a few days of being informed of the hospitalâ€™s financial decision. The patient died the day after the transfer. The wife then sued, basing a claim under EMTALA for the hospitalâ€™s failure to comply with the statuteâ€™s stabilization and transfer requirements.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The Fourth Circuit upheld the dismissal of the plaintiffâ€™s EMTALA claim. The court stated that because the dialysis was discontinued because of the wifeâ€™s informed decision, it was impossible for her to claim that the hospital did not meet its duty of stabilization under EMTALA. The court found the case hardly distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Bryan</span> and, accordingly, determined that EMTALA only applied to the initial emergency stabilization. In addition, the court reaffirmed that recovery for allegedly inadequate care beyond the initial emergency treatment should be sought through existing state malpractice laws.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"></a>Decisions Applying EMTALA to Inpatients<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Rather than limit EMTALAâ€™s application to the initial treatment and stabilization of emergency patients, the First and Sixth Circuits have applied EMTALAâ€™s stabilization and transfer requirements to hospital inpatients. These courts have interpreted the subsections of the statute independently. Thus, the stabilization and transfer requirements in subsections (b) and (c) apply to all patients who have come to the hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"></a>Thornton v. Southwest Detroit Hosp., 895 F.2d 1131 (6th Cir. 1990)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In <span class="Italic">Thornton</span>, the patient was transferred to the hospital following a stroke. She entered the hospital through its emergency room, and was admitted to the intensive care unit. After a three-week stay, including 11 days in regular inpatient care, the attending physician recommended that the patient be discharged to a rehabilitation facility. However, the rehabilitation facility refused to accept her because she could not afford the treatment, and the patient instead was released to her sisterâ€™s home until she could eventually gain admission to the rehabilitation facility. The patient sued under EMTALA, claiming that the hospital failed to stabilize the EMC that brought her to the hospital. The district court granted summary judgment to the hospital, finding that the hospital had in fact stabilized the patient within the meaning of the law.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The Sixth Circuit upheld the dismissal of the patientâ€™s EMTALA claim since she failed to make a showing that she was not stabilized at the time of discharge. The court specifically noted that its decision was not based on the length of the patientâ€™s stay and treatment in the hospital. At the same time, the court rejected the hospitalâ€™s defense that EMTALA did not apply to the patient because she was not discharged from the emergency department.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Instead, the court examined the different wording in subsections (a) and (b) of EMTALA to mean "that once a patient is found to suffer from an emergency medical condition in the emergency room, she cannot be discharged until the condition is stabilized, regardless of whether the patient stays in the emergency room." As further stated by the court:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">Although emergency care often occurs, and almost invariably begins, in the emergency room, emergency care does not always stop when a patient is wheeled from the emergency room into the main hospital â€¦ Emergency care must be given until the patientâ€™s emergency medical condition is stabilized.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Although the <span class="Italic">Thornton</span> opinion is noteworthy in its implication that EMTALA applies to inpatients, the court appears to limit the reach of EMTALA only to those patients who first present in the emergency room.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"></a>Roberts v. Galen of Virginia, Inc., 525 U.S. 249 (1999)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In <span class="Italic">Roberts</span>, a car accident victim was hospitalized for several weeks before the hospital could find a skilled nursing care facility that would agree to take her for long-term care. The patientâ€™s guardian (her aunt) sued the hospital for failure to stabilize her niece prior to transfer. As discussed above, the Sixth Circuit rejected the plaintiffâ€™s EMTALA claim since she failed to show that the transfer was based on an improper motive. It is noteworthy that the appellate court did not address whether EMTALA applied to this case; rather, the court merely cited its <span class="Italic">Thornton</span> decision (discussed above) in a footnote for the proposition that EMTALA applied to an inpatient discharge.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">During oral argument of this case before the U.S. Supreme Court, the federal government advised the court that it would adopt regulations clarifying whether EMTALA applied to inpatients. Accordingly, the court did not provide insight in <span class="Italic">Roberts</span> as to whether EMTALA applies to inpatients, despite the existing conflict over this issue among the lower courts.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"></a>Lopez-Soto v. Hawayek, 175 F.3d 170 (1st Cir. 1999)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In <span class="Italic">Lopez-Soto</span>, the plaintiff was admitted to the maternity ward and gave birth by cesarean section in the operating room to a baby boy who suffered from severe respiratory distress and a pulmonary pneumothorax. The pediatrician determined that the infant required neonatal intensive care available at another hospital; however, the court observed that the pediatrician did not attempt to stabilize the infant or treat him before transfer that evening. The child died the next day.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In reinstating the plaintiffâ€™s claim, the First Circuit explored the relationship of the subsections of EMTALA, and found that they established independent obligations. According to the court, although the screening requirement in subsection (a) refers only to the emergency department, the further treatment and stabilizing treatment requirement in subsection (b) refers to all patients who come to a hospital with an emergency condition. The court stated that the language in subsection (b) "unambiguously imposes certain duties on covered hospitals vis-Ã -vis any victim of a detected medical emergency, regardless of how that person enters the institution or where within the walls he may be when the hospital identifies the problem." Therefore, although the infant entered the hospital through the operating room, his emergency condition entitled him to necessary stabilizing treatment under EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">After reviewing the split among the circuit courts (discussed above), the court decided that Congress would not have used particularly different language in subsections (a) and (b) of the statute if it had intended to protect only the emergency department patients identified in subsection (a) from patient dumping. According to the court, "Congressâ€™ decision to change the â€˜emergency departmentâ€™ language rather than repeat it in subsection (b) is potent evidence that Congress preferred to cast a wider net in respect to stabilization."</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The court concluded that the hospitalâ€™s detection of the infantâ€™s emergency condition triggered the stabilization and transfer requirements under EMTALA. However, the court declined to express a view on the application of EMTALA to patients with continuing unstable conditions (as was the issue in the Fourth Circuit cases above), because the <span class="Italic">Lopez-Soto</span> situation did not call for it. But the court did suggest in a footnote that the issue was a "conundrum" to be dealt with at a later day.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"></a>Postscript</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">All of the foregoing court decisions were rendered prior to the revision of the EMTALA regulations by CMS in 2003. CMS has interpreted the EMTALA statute as not applying to inpatients. The application of EMTALA by CMS to inpatients is discussed further in chapter 2, "When and Where Does EMTALA Begin and End?" Although CMS developed the 2003 regulations based on its view of prevailing judicial trends on the application of EMTALA to inpatients, courts that have previously extended EMTALA to inpatients may not follow the CMS interpretation. As discussed below, the Sixth Circuit decision in <span class="Italic">Moses v. Providence</span> (discussed earlier in this chapter) reaffirmed the view of the Sixth Circuit that the EMTALA obligations apply to inpatients regardless of the contrary CMS regulation. In addition, a District Court in Texas more recently made a distinction in <span class="Italic">Liles v. TH Healthcare LTD</span> (discussed below) between a patientâ€™s "administrative status (i.e., admitted as a bona fide patient)" and a patientâ€™s medical status and whether it was "stabilized," to apply EMTALA to an inpatient.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"></a>Moses v. Providence Hospital and Medical Ctrs., 561 F.3d 573 (6th Cir. 2009)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">As discussed earlier in this chapter, plaintiff Moses-Irons took her estranged husband Howard to the emergency room due to physical and acute psychiatric distress. Howard was admitted as an inpatient, discharged six days later, and murdered Moses-Irons ten days later. Relying on the 2003 CMS regulation providing that a hospital satisfies its EMTALA obligations by screening and admitting an individual, the hospital argued that it had discharged its EMTALA obligations by providing a screening examination and then admitting her husband to an inpatient care unit for further testing and care. The Sixth Circuit disagreed, stating that the CMS regulation is inconsistent with EMTALAâ€™s language prohibiting a hospital from releasing a patient without first determining that the patient is actually stabilized. In other words, merely admitting her husband as an inpatient and subjecting him to further testing did not discharge the hospitalâ€™s EMTALA obligations â€” the hospital was obligated to actually treat and stabilize her husband before discharge.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"></a>Liles v. TH Healthcare, LTD, et al., No. 2:11-cv-528-JRG (E.D. Tex. Sept. 10, 2012) </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The <span class="Italic">Liles</span> case addressed two separate ED visits by an uninsured patient for EMTALA claims. Plaintiff Liles first came to the emergency room complaining of fever, cough, and shortness of breath and was admitted to the hospital. Over the next few days, Liles contended that while his condition was unstable, various physicians and nurses attempted to transfer him out of the hospital on 18 separate occasions. At one point, he was certified stable for transfer, but at or near the time he was placed in the ambulance he went into cardiac arrest. He was brought back into the hospitalâ€™s ICU for approximately one month before being discharged home. The second visit occurred two days after the discharge when Liles was transported to the hospital by ambulance. The hospital refused to admit him for treatment on the grounds that there was no pulmonologist available to evaluate and treat him at the hospital. Liles was eventually transferred to another facility and was diagnosed with a collapsed lung.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Regarding the first visit, the hospital argued that the plaintiffâ€™s EMTALA claims were barred because he had been admitted to a hospital as a bona fide inpatient. The court rejected this argument, citing the statutory language of EMTALA without reference to the regulations and case law from the Fifth Circuit. More specifically, the court held that the plain language of the EMTALA statute indicates that a hospital may not transfer an individual with an emergency medical condition that has not been "stabilized." The court acknowledged the Fifth Circuitâ€™s holding that a hospitalâ€™s responsibility under EMTALA ends when it has stabilized the individualâ€™s medical condition. Therefore, the court found that the application of EMTALA does not depend on the patientâ€™s administrative status (i.e., admitted as an inpatient), but on his or her medical status and whether it was "stabilized." The court determined that Liles had pled sufficient facts to state a plausible EMTALA claim that his medical condition was not "stabilized" prior to his discharge from his first visit to the hospital, even though he was an inpatient at the time.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">It is important to note that the court did not address the 2003 EMTALA regulations in its decision.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"></a>Application to <a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a>Ambulance Patients</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">As discussed in chapter 2, "When and Where Does EMTALA Begin and End?" the EMTALA regulations provide that a patient in a nonhospital-owned ambulance off hospital property is not considered to have come to the hospitalâ€™s emergency department, even if a member of the ambulance staff contacts the hospital and requests transport to the hospital for a patient. In <span class="Italic">Arrington vs. Wong</span>, 237 F.3d 1066 (9th Cir. 2001), ambulance personnel contacted a hospital to which they were transporting a patient in severe respiratory distress. The emergency physician asked the ambulance attendant the name of the patientâ€™s physician, and then told the attendant that it "would be okay" to take the patient to a military hospital. Following the death of the patient, the family brought an action against the hospital (among others) alleging an EMTALA violation for refusing the ambulance. The district court dismissed the action on the grounds that the patient never came to the hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">On appeal, the court interpreted the phrase "comes to the emergency department" to include both the physical arrival on the hospital grounds, as well as the act of traveling to the hospital. The court then reviewed the regulation on ambulances, and noted that a hospital may deny access when it is on diversion. The court interpreted the diversion language as prohibiting a hospital from denying individual access unless it is on diversion. Therefore, the court held that a hospital not on diversion must have a valid treatment-related reason to refuse to accept a patient in a nonhospital-owned ambulance.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In 2008, the First Circuit came to the same conclusion on similar facts. In <span class="Italic">Morales v. Sociedad Espanola De Auxilio Mutuo Y Beneficencia et al.</span>, 524 F.3d 54 (1st Cir. 2008), ambulance personnel contacted the hospital to which they were transporting a patient in pregnancy-related distress. The emergency physician told the ambulance attendant that he was worried that the plaintiff might voluntarily have induced an abortion, that he was very busy and to call back. When the paramedics called again, the emergency physician asked whether the patient had insurance and when he did not receive an affirmative response, hung up the phone. The paramedics took this as a refusal to treat the patient and took her to an alternate facility. The patient and her family brought an action against the hospital alleging an EMTALA violation for refusing the ambulance. The district court granted the hospital summary judgment, but the First Circuit reversed, holding that an individual can "come to" the emergency department for EMTALA purposes without physically arriving on the hospitalâ€™s grounds as long as the individual is en route to the hospital and the emergency department has been notified of the individualâ€™s imminent arrival.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Many commentators have been critical of the <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> and <span class="Italic">Morales</span> decisions since the regulation specifically states that a nonhospital-owned ambulance must be on hospital property in order to trigger the EMTALA obligations. Although some CMS personnel have suggested that <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> does not reflect CMS policy, it declined to revise its definition of "comes to the emergency department" in the revised EMTALA regulations. Although it is uncertain whether CMS would confirm an EMTALA violation for a similar case, <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> and <span class="Italic">Morales</span> remain the interpretation of EMTALA in the Ninth Circuit (which includes California) and First Circuit, respectively, for private EMTALA lawsuits against hospitals.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"></a>Application to Urgent Care Centers<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"></a>Friedrich et al. v South County Hospital Healthcare System, et al., 221 F. Supp. 3d 240 (D. Rhode Island 2016)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In <span class="Italic">Friedrich</span>, the patient presented to the hospitalâ€™s Urgen<span class="No-break">t/W</span>alk-In Care complaining of severe pain and burning in chest and right arm. She was diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease, given a "GI cocktail," and discharged with no follow-up ordered. The next day she was found unresponsive at home, transported to the hospital, and pronounced dead. The cause of death was confirmed as atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The issue the court explored was whether the Urgen<span class="No-break">t/W</span>alk-In Care was subject to EMTALA, and therefore required to provide an appropriate medical screening and stabilizing treatment. The decision focused on whether the Urgen<span class="No-break">t/W</span>alk-In Care met the definition of a "dedicated emergency department" of the hospital. Under CMSâ€™ definition (including a department of the hospital that is "held out to the public by name, posted signs, advertising or other means as a place that provides care for emergency medical conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment"), the court noted that the most important criterion is whether the clinic would be perceived by an individual as an appropriate place to go for emergency care. In that case, even though the hospitalâ€™s website stated that the clinic was for "non-emergency needs," and that it did not provide "emergency room level care," the court found that a person driving by and seeking emergency care would not first check the website; the court also indicated that the signage did not distinguish "urgent" care from "emergency" care. Since patients would believe that the urgen<span class="No-break">t/w</span>alk-in care clinic was held out as an appropriate place to go for emergency care, it was a "dedicated emergency department" under EMTALA.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"></a>Duty to Treat â€” Inadequate Examination or Refusal or Failure to Treat<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"></a>Inadequate Examination or Stabilization</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The courts have held that a patient may establish a cause of action under EMTALA if a hospital fails to provide an appropriate medical screening examination or stabilize an EMC before transferring a patient to another hospital.

From the beginning of EMTALA, there have been numerous lawsuits against hospitals seeking damages under EMTALA for an inadequate medical screening.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In <span class="Italic">Jackson v. East Bay Hospital</span> (246 F.3d 1248, 1257 (9th Cir. 2001)) the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal addressed the standards for providing the medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment. In <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, the patient presented to the hospital emergency department three times in a four-day period. The initial visit resulted from the referral of the patient who had a psychotic disorder by county mental health for medical clearance; the emergency physician obtained a history, performed a physical examination, ordered tests and determined that there was no medical emergency. Two days later, the patient presented again with a complaint of sore throat, chest pain and dry heaves. The emergency physician saw the patient, ordered EKG and lab tests, diagnosed chest contusions, hypertension and psychosis, prescribed medication and discharged the patient with instructions to return to county mental health the following day. On the following day, the patient was taken to the emergency department after he was found wandering in the road; the emergency physician prescribed additional medication. On request of county mental health, the emergency physician arranged the transfer of the patient to an inpatient psychiatric hospital. Shortly after arrival at the receiving hospital, the patient went into cardiac arrest, and subsequently died following transfer to a third hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In reviewing the three screening examinations performed by the hospital, the court adopted the "comparative test" that had been followed by seven other judicial circuits. A medical screening must be comparable to the screening provided to patients presenting with similar signs and symptoms, unless the examination is so cursory that it is not designed to identify acute or severe symptoms alerting the physician to a possible emergency condition. The court therefore upheld the finding of the district court that the patient received a medical screening on each visit, and that expert witnesses did not believe that this patient was treated differently from other patients presenting with similar signs and symptoms.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The court also adopted the "actual detection" standard that had been followed by five other judicial circuits, and affirmed that a hospital is required to stabilize only those medical conditions that it has detected. The court reaffirmed that EMTALA is not a medical malpractice statute by finding that if the medical screening meets the comparative test, there is no EMTALA liability for failure to identify the patientâ€™s condition or to transfer and discharge the patient based on that assessment.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In an unpublished 2007 decision,<span class="CharOverride-5"><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap14_rebuild.html#footnote-000" data-href="footnote-000">2</a></span></span> a federal district court considered when a medical screening examination is so cursory that it is not designed to identify acute or severe symptoms alerting the physician to a possible EMC. In <span class="Italic">Lewellen v. Schneck Medical Center </span><span class="No-break"><span class="Italic">a/k</span></span><span class="Italic">/a Schneck Memorial Hospital et al.</span>, an intoxicated driver was injured when he drove off an interstate highway into a ditch 50 to 100 yards from the road. The paramedics transported the driver to a hospital emergency department due to the driverâ€™s complaint of lower back pain. The patient records indicated that the emergency physician examined the patient, noting a complaint of lower back pain and tenderness of his lumbar spine. The emergency physician also ordered X-rays of the patientâ€™s lumbar and cervical spine.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">A little over an hour after arrival, the emergency physician discharged the patient, despite the patientâ€™s pleading with an emergency department nurse that he was in tremendous pain and wanted to see the physician. The court noted that the last of the X-rays had not been printed at the time of the discharge order.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">According to the court, the emergency physician at some point noted in the medical record that the X-rays did not reveal a fracture and the patientâ€™s lack of cooperation caused the films to be of poor quality. In a quality control process, a hospital radiologist reviewed the films two hours after discharge and noted an ossific density that could be a bone spur, and could not completely exclude a fracture due to the poor quality of the X-rays. The court noted that the radiologist did not notify the emergency physician of his findings, despite hospital protocol.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Lewellen subsequently sued the medical center alleging that the emergency physician failed to provide an appropriate medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment for what turned out to be a burst fracture in his lower back. The court cited the Jackson decision, noting two prongs to the screening test â€” differential screening and cursory screening. The court then sided with the medical center that Lewellen had not presented evidence that the screening of his medical condition differed from the screening provided to any other patient.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">However, the court then determined that a reasonable jury could conclude that the screening was so cursory that it was not designed to identify acute and severe symptoms. The medical center argued that the emergency physician had performed a neurological examination that appeared normal, and exercised medical judgment in concluding the patient could be safely discharged. The court rejected the medical centerâ€™s argument and its request for summary judgment on Lewellenâ€™s EMTALA claim, stating the following:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">But according to the evidence presented by the Plaintiffs, the X-rays ordered by Dr. Resiert were being printed off as Lewellen was being discharged. A jury could conclude that either Dr. Reisert did not even bother to look at them or looked at them so casually that he missed what two other physicians said was obvious: that the X-rays demonstrate that Lewellen had a burst fracture in his spine. If Reisert did not study the X-rays how could his screen be designed to identify acute and severe symptoms? Lewellenâ€™s stay at the hospital was alarmingly brief considering he was in a motor vehicle accident and complaining of severe back pain so bad that he could not stand or sit in a chair correctly. Lewellen still had a bleeding gash in his arm with grass and dirt when he arrived at prison. The court is mindful that EMTALAâ€™s screening requirement means more than an inadvertent failure to follow the regular screening process in a particular caseâ€¦But this scenario is so grave that a jury could conclude that rather than a negligent deviation from normal practice, the screening requirement was simply not met." [citations omitted]</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In general, the courts have held that EMTALA is not intended to ensure each emergency room patient a correct diagnosis, but rather to ensure that each patient is accorded the same level of treatment regularly provided to patients in similar medical circumstances. A misdiagnosis alone does not create a cause of action under EMTALA. As stated by one court, "what constitutes an â€˜appropriateâ€™ screening is properly determined not by reference to particular outcomes but instead by reference to a hospitalâ€™s standard screening procedures." This has resulted in most courts looking for evidence as to whether a hospital followed its policies and procedures, provided a medical screening examination to determine whether a patient had an EMC, and treated a patient in the same manner as other patients presenting with similar symptoms and conditions. However, the analysis and application of EMTALA in the <span class="Italic">Lewellen</span> decision (even if not a published decision) is a reminder the examination must also meet the "cursory screening" test described in the <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> decision.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"></a>Duty to Treat â€” Extent of Treatment<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In the <span class="Italic">Matter of Baby "K,"</span> 16 F.3d 590 (4th Cir. 1994), the court held that EMTALA "does not provide an exception for stabilizing treatment physicians may deem medically or ethically inappropriate." In this case, the hospital sought a declaration from the court that EMTALA does not require continuation of emergency medical treatment (other than warmth, hydration and nutrition) for an anencephalic infant when the physicians and hospital, in accordance with hospital and community standards, determine that treatment would be futile. The court rejected the hospitalâ€™s arguments, finding that the hospital was required to provide treatment necessary to prevent the material deterioration of the patientâ€™s EMC (in this case, to provide respiratory support). The court also rejected the hospitalâ€™s argument that EMTALA did not require a hospital to provide treatment exceeding the prevailing standard of care, stating that the hospital was obligated to provide stabilizing care for anencephalic infants in the same manner as comatose, cancer or muscular dystrophy patients who may repeatedly present in respiratory distress.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"></a>Failure to Provide Appropriate Transfer<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As described in chapter 5, "Transferring or Discharging an Emergency Patient," if an individual has an EMC that a hospital does not have the capability to treat, or upon the informed request by the patient, EMTALA obligates a hospital to make an appropriate transfer of an individual to another hospital. There have been several lawsuits against hospitals seeking damages under EMTALA challenging the sufficiency of an informed request for transfer and the physician certification.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As discussed more fully in chapter 5, a 2009 federal district court in <span class="Italic">Guzman v. Memorial Hermann Hospital System</span> (S.D.Tex., No. H-07-3973, June 16, 2009), addressed a patientâ€™s informed request for transfer. The court stated that a hospital cannot meet its EMTALA obligation to obtain patient consent to transfer (as opposed to physician certification) by merely having a patient or proxy sign a form. Rather, EMTALA requires that the hospital inform the patient about the hospitalâ€™s obligations to provide examination and stabilizing treatment as well as the risks and benefits of transfer before initiating the request and having the patient or proxy sign the form.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In a separate 2009 decision, a District Court in Iowa reviewed the sufficiency of the physician certification, finding a lack of evidence that the physician adequately deliberated and weighed the medical risks and benefits of a transfer. The court also found that the physician gave improper consideration to significant factors in certifying the transfer (<span class="Italic">Heimlicher v. Steele </span>(615 F.Supp.2d 884, 2009)).

Each hospital should have a board-approved policy mandating compliance with EMTALA, and making compliance a substantial part of its in-service education, quality improvement and risk management programs. A model hospital policy on compliance with EMTALA is attached as Appendix O of the manual.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">EMTALA should also be part of a hospitalâ€™s compliance program. Failure to comply with EMTALA should be viewed as potentially exposing the hospital to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) enforcement action, possible monetary sanctions, patient litigation and adverse publicity. Responding to a CMS enforcement survey is time-consuming, costly and highly disruptive, and often places a high degree of stress on emergency personnel, as well as other departments responsible for ensuring EMTALA compliance.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">CMS and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) are interested in the quality improvement processes used by hospitals to evaluate EMTALA compliance, train personnel and implement corrective action. CMS routinely advises its surveyors to review the quality management process as part of an EMTALA survey. In more than one sanction case, the OIG inquired as to the actions taken by a hospital medical staff to evaluate the failure of an on-call physician to accept a patient. An attorney representing the OIG suggested that action by the medical staff or the hospital to discipline an on-call physician for refusal to accept a call when required to do so would be viewed favorably by the OIG in deciding whether to seek sanctions against the hospital for transferring a patient due to the on-call failure.</p></li>

In response to the Congressional authorization, HHS adopted amendments to the EMTALA regulations in 2003 that precluded the imposition of sanctions for an inappropriate transfer during a national emergency by a hospital located in an emergency area.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-2"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-3">Pub.

The expanded authority permitted the Secretary of HHS to temporarily waive or modify the application of EMTALA standards pertaining to the transfer of an individual who has not been stabilized to receive medical screening in an alternate location if the transfer is required by the circumstances of a declared emergency in the emergency area during the emergency period in accordance with an appropriate state emergency preparedness plan.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-2"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	Reference:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-3">Pub.

Similar to the emergency waiver, the pandemic waiver may be terminated earlier if the state emergency pandemic preparedness plan is deactivated before the expiration of the hospital pandemic waiver. In addition, CMS may terminate the pandemic waiver for a specific hospital or group of hospitals before the termination of the public health emergency if there is a determination that the pandemic waiver is no longer necessary for the affected hospitals.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>Effect of an EMTALA Waiver<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">If a waiver is issued by HHS, hospitals in the emergency area must continue to meet all EMTALA requirements except for the obligations that are excused or suspended under the terms of the waiver. As discussed below, the language of the waiver authority is critically important in determining the specific requirements that are suspended during the period of the emergency, and in determining which hospitals within an emergency area are covered by the waiver.</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Medical Screening<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Hospitals should review very carefully the scope of the waiver and their state emergency preparedness plan, and consult with legal counsel as necessary. Within the capacity of the hospital, the review should consider:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Whether the waiver covers the hospital;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">If the waiver covers the hospital, does it permit the hospital to redirect or relocate all patients (such as in an earthquake or other natural disaster) who present for emergency services to other facilities that are designated by state or local health officers for medical screening and examination; or</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Does the waiver permit the hospital to redirect or relocate only those patients whose presenting complaints relate to the national emergency (e.g., patients presenting with pandemic flu symptoms or victims of bioterrorism) to other designated facilities while still providing medical screening to patients whose presenting complaints are unrelated to the emergency (such as women in labor or patients with psychiatric emergencies)?</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As explained in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, CMS expects that in all cases, persons who are protected under EMTALA will receive appropriate medical screening examinations somewhere, even if not at the hospital to which they present.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a>Transfers<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The wording of the waiver with respect to transfers should also be reviewed very closely. For example, the Katrina waiver lifted the obligation to make an appropriate transfer if the transfer was required by the circumstances of the declared emergency. However, even if the transfer falls within the scope of the waiver and the hospital is excused from meeting the technical requirements of EMTALA, the hospital should make reasonable efforts to explain the need for the transfer to the patient and provide, under the circumstances, any available assistance to facilitate the transfer. Similar to the expectations for medical screening, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> indicate the expectation of CMS that all persons with EMCs who are transferred will be routed to facilities that are capable of providing stabilizing services.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a>Other Obligations<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The scope of the statutory authorization to waive EMTALA requirements is limited to medical screening (which, as noted above, may be limited or broad in scope) and transfers required by the emergent situation. Therefore, other obligations (such as on-call, central log, etc.) may be in force during an emergency. In this regard, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> reinforce that the obligation to accept the transfer of individuals with EMCs is not waived during the declaration of an emergency. Importantly, even if a hospital is covered by a waiver, the hospital is prohibited from discriminating in the provision of all emergency services and care on the basis of an individualâ€™s source of payment or ability to pay. Further, the waiver authority does not eliminate the private right of individuals to bring actions for EMTALA violations (although the effect of the waiver may substantially diminish or even eliminate the likelihood of success of any subsequent litigation alleging an EMTALA violation during a disaster or public health emergency).</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"></a>Hospitals Outside the Designated Emergency Area<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As discussed above, HHS may waive EMTALA requirements for some or all hospitals that are located within an emergency area. However, under the statutory waiver authority and the EMTALA regulations, HHS does not have the authority to reduce or eliminate compliance with the EMTALA obligations for hospitals that are outside of the designated emergency area, even if they serve as catchment facilities for transfers outside of the emergency area. Hospitals outside of the designated emergency area will continue to be subject to EMTALA within their capacity and capability.</p></li></ol></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"></a>Options for Managing Extraordinary Ed <a id="_idIndexMarker002"></a>Surges Without a Waiver<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">On Aug. 14, 2009, CMS issued a Fact Sheet that provides guidance to hospitals with regard to managing extraordinary emergency department surges under existing EMTALA requirements, in the absence of a waiver that covers the hospital. While the Fact Sheet aims to provide guidance to hospitals that are worried about an influenza outbreak, the guidance is also applicable to other public health and emergency situations. CMS suggests three options for hospitals to consider in such situations that meet EMTALA requirements and that do not require a waiver:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">A hospital may set up alternative screening sites on the hospitalâ€™s campus. The medical screening examination does not need to take place in the emergency department, and a hospital can set up alternative sites on its campus to perform the screening.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">A hospital may set up screening at off-campus, hospital-controlled sites. Hospitals and community officials can encourage the public to go to these alternate sites instead of the emergency department for screening of certain symptoms (such as flu-like symptoms). However, a hospital cannot tell individuals who have already arrived at the emergency department to go to the off-site location for screening.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">Communities can set up screening clinics at sites that are not under the control of a hospital. These sites are not subject to EMTALA requirements. Hospitals and communities may encourage people to go to these sites instead of the hospital for screening, but a hospital cannot tell individuals who have already arrived at the emergency department to go to the off-site location for screening.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> Implementation of the above options may require compliance with hospital disaster and overflow plans established under state licensing requirements, including prior approval of the Licensing and Certification Division of the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).
