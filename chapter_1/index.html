				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor002"></a>Emtala Overview And History  <ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor003"></a>The EMTALA Statute  <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) was enacted by Congress as a part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 to ensure access to emergency services. The statute was amended in 1988, 1989, 2003 and 2011. EMTALA applies to anyone who presents for emergency services to a hospital that participates in the Medicare program (including psychiatric hospitals). The EMTALA statute is included as Appendix A. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">EMTALA was enacted in response to studies that found that indigent emergency patients had been turned away from hospitals for necessary services or transferred (i.e., “dumped”) to public and charity hospitals in an unstabilized condition. Although EMTALA was passed to mandate access to emergency services by the indigent, Congress applied the EMTALA requirements to all patients regardless of financial or insurance status. In general, both the federal regulatory agencies and the courts have defined the primary objectives of EMTALA as twofold: to enhance access by all persons to emergency services and to prohibit <a id="_idIndexMarker000"></a>discrimination in the provision of emergency services to persons presenting with the same or similar types of conditions. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"></a>The EMTALA Regulations <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The initial EMTALA regulations were published in draft form in 1988, and issued as interim final regulations on June 22, 1994. On April 7, 2000, the regulations were amended to apply the EMTALA obligations to off-campus hospital services. In September 2003, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (<a id="_idIndexMarker001"></a>CMS) published further changes to the EMTALA regulations, repealing part of the 2000 regulations and clarifying the application of EMTALA to emergency patients, outpatients and inpatients. Since 2004, CMS has amended the EMTALA regulations in piecemeal fashion in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. The current regulations are included as Appendix B. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>The EMTALA <span class="CharOverride-1">Interpretive Guidelines</span> <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker002"></a>CMS has adopted <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> as part of the <span class="Italic">Medicare State Operations Manual</span> to provide guidance for federal and state surveyors in their enforcement of EMTALA. Although the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> are not regulations, they are considered the official interpretation of EMTALA by CMS and are used by California Department of Public Health (CDPH) surveyors and CMS regional offices in enforcement of the EMTALA obligations. The most recent update to the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> was July 16, 2010; the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> are included as Appendix C. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="All-Caps-Bold">Note:</span> The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> are organized by “<a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a>tag numbers,” each of which corresponds to a CMS regulation that establishes the rules for EMTALA. The tag numbers beginning with the letter “A” are applicable to hospitals and the tag numbers beginning with the letter “C” are applicable to <a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a>critical access hospitals. Each tag number has four digits, with the number “2” at the beginning of each tag number. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker005"></a>Special Advisory Bulletins and Other Guidance <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">In November 1999, CMS and the <a id="_idIndexMarker006"></a>Office of Inspector General (OIG) released a final Special Advisory Bulletin on EMTALA and managed care. The Bulletin discusses the rules on seeking health plan authorization prior to the medical screening examination (which were added to the EMTALA regulations in 2003), dual staffing of emergency departments and recommended patient registration practices to minimize violations of EMTALA. The Bulletin is discussed in chapter 4, “Financial Considerations — EMTALA and Managed Care,” and is included as Appendix H. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">From time to time, CMS issues Program Memoranda on various subjects relating to EMTALA obligations. Most of these memoranda have been incorporated into the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span><span class="Italic"> </span>(Appendix C). This manual includes the latest CMS guidance on critical access hospital on-call compliance with EMTALA (Appendix Y), conflicting payor requirements (Appendix X), and Ebola implications for EMTALA (Appendix AA). These memoranda are also described in detail in applicable chapters of this manual. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>Enforcement and Penalties <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The EMTALA obligations are a condition of the Medicare provider agreement (rather than a Condition of Participation), thereby permitting CMS to terminate a provider upon a confirmed violation of EMTALA. As described in chapter 13, “Regulatory Enforcement of EMTALA,” the federal agencies charged with ensuring EMTALA compliance are CMS and the OIG. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">CMS has the authority to conduct complaint and enforcement surveys for EMTALA compliance, and to terminate a hospital’s Medicare provider agreement upon confirming one or more violations of EMTALA. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Under the EMTALA statute (Appendix A), the OIG has the authority to impose civil money penalties up to $50,000 against hospitals and physicians ($25,000 for hospitals with less than 100 beds), an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r to exclude a hospital or physician from the Medicare and Medicaid programs for violations of EMTALA that are “gross and flagrant or repeated.” In December 2016, the OIG issued final regulations updating the amount of civil money penalties, including EMTALA fines. Effective in 2017, the OIG may now impose civil penalties up to $104,826 against hospitals and physicians ($52,414 for hospitals with less than 100 beds) for an EMTALA violation. The maximum amount of the fines is subject to annual adjustment for inflation. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The regional <a id="_idIndexMarker007"></a>quality improvement organization (QIO) is responsible for assisting CMS and OIG review patient stabilization and other medical matters pertaining to the delivery of emergency care and services. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">For hospitals that have community service obligations under the <a id="_idIndexMarker008"></a>Hill-Burton Act, the <a id="_idIndexMarker009"></a>Office for Civil Rights (OCR) will follow up on violations of EMTALA confirmed by CMS with a request for copies of EMTALA compliance, transfer, admission and other hospital policies.  </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>EMTALA Committees and Reports </li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Since 2001, there have been a number of committees and governmental agencies that have issued reports on EMTALA, including reports regarding compliance by hospitals and physicians with EMTALA standards, the enforcement process and the overall effect of the law. </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker010"></a>Office of Inspector General </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In January 2001, the OIG released two reports on EMTALA: “Survey of Hospital Emergency Departments” and “The Enforcement Process.” </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIG’s “Survey of Hospital Emergency Departments” made the following findings: </p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Emergency department personnel are familiar with the EMTALA requirements, but many are unaware of recent policy changes. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Training increases EMTALA familiarity for all staff; unfortunately, on-call specialists and staff in high-volume emergency departments are less likely to receive training. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Hospital staff report that hospitals generally comply with EMTALA, but some express concerns about compliance. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Hospital staff believe that some aspects of EMTALA are unclear or questionable. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Hospital staff believe that while EMTALA may help protect patients, it also may contribute to a hospital’s administrative and financial problems. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Investigations, many of which do not confirm violations, often prompt changes in forms and procedures. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Managed care creates special problems for hospitals in complying with EMTALA. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Hospitals have difficulty staffing on-call panels for some specialists. </li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIG report made three conclusions: </p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">CMS should use a variety of methods to communicate important policy changes, including e-mail and the Internet. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">CMS should support legislation that compels managed care plans to reimburse hospitals for EMTALA-related services, including screening exams that do not reveal the presence of an emergency medical condition. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Uncompensated care and on-call panels are very complex problems that may require action at the federal, state and local levels, as well as by private entities. </li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIG reported that CMS concurred with its recommendations. </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In “The Enforcement Process” report, the OIG issued the following findings on the EMTALA enforcement process: </p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">The EMTALA enforcement process is compromised by long delays and inadequate feedback. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The number of EMTALA investigations and their ultimate disposition vary widely by CMS region and year. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Poor tracking of EMTALA cases impede oversight. </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Peer review is not always obtained before CMS considers terminating a hospital for medical reasons. </li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIG report recommended that CMS increase its oversight of the regional offices, improve collection and access to EMTALA data, ensure that peer review occurs for cases involving medical judgment, and establish an EMTALA technical advisory group. The OIG reported that CMS concurred with its recommendations. </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker011"></a>General Accountability Office </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In June 2001, the U.S. General Accountability Office (GAO) released its own report entitled “EMTALA Implementation and Enforcement Issues.” Among other findings, the GAO reported that providers generally support the goals of EMTALA, but are uncertain about the extent of their obligations and have concerns about its effects on emergency care. In Table 1 of the report, the GAO listed seven issues identified as provider uncertainties: </p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">Scope of the medical screening exam </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Definition of patient stability for transfer </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Obligations for post-hospital care </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List"><a id="_idIndexMarker012"></a>Application of the 250-yard rule </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Obligations related to patients in other hospital departments </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Requirement for on-call coverage </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Compliance with local emergency medical systems for routing of ambulances </li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The comments by CMS on those issues are addressed in various sections of this manual. </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Regarding the enforcement of EMTALA, the GAO reported that most EMTALA violations involve failure to screen, stabilize or transfer appropriately. They noted that although hospitals have concerns about CMS enforcement, CMS usually accepts corrective action plans and rarely terminates hospitals from the Medicare program. Finally, the GAO found that the OIG focuses on future compliance in assessing fines for EMTALA violations, and generally does not pursue a physician in the absence of clearly culpable behavior. The GAO endorsed many of the OIG recommendations in the two earlier reports discussed above. </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In April 2009, the GAO issued a report entitled “Hospital Emergency Departments — Crowding Continues to Occur, and Some Patients Wait Longer than Recommended Time Frames.” The report looked at indicators of emergency department crowding, including ambulance diversion, wait times and patient boarding. The report determined that the primary factor for emergency department crowding is the lack of inpatient beds, with the following secondary factors: lack of access to primary care, a shortage of available on-call specialists and difficulties with transferring or discharging psychiatric patients. The report, “GAO-09-347,” can be accessed on the GAO website at <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09347.pdf">www.gao.go<span class="No-break">v/n</span>ew.item<span class="No-break">s/</span><span class="No-break">d</span>09347.pdf</a>. </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a>EMTALA <a id="_idIndexMarker013"></a>Technical Advisory Group </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In the 2003 Medicare reform legislation, Congress directed the Secretary of HHS to establish a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to solicit advice concerning the EMTALA regulations and enforcement. The Secretary signed the charter establishing the TAG on May 11, 2004; the TAG had a term of 30 months. The TAG was composed of 19 members, including four hospital representatives and seven physicians. The final meeting of the TAG was Sept. 17-18, 2007. </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The TAG had the following responsibilities: </p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">Review the EMTALA regulations; </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Provide advice and recommendations to the Secretary concerning the regulations and their application to hospitals and physicians; </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Solicit comments and recommendations from providers and the public regarding the implementation of the regulations; and </li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Disseminate information on the EMTALA regulations to providers and the public. </li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">During its tenure, the TAG issued seven reports and made several recommendations to CMS, some of which resulted in changes to the regulations and others in updated guidance issued in Program Memoranda. At its final meeting, the TAG adopted a series of recommendations related to accepting hospital obligations, clarification of conditions that constitute an “emergency medical condition,” clarification of the term “stabilization” (including a proposed concept of “temporary stabilization”), and procedures and criteria for transferring patients with stabilized conditions to physician offices for follow-up evaluation and care. It is uncertain whether these recommendations will be accepted by CMS, and if so, whether there will be any changes. </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Further information on the TAG, including meeting agendas and reports, is available on the CMS website at <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/EMTALA/03_emtalatag.asp">www.cms.hhs.go<span class="No-break">v/E</span>MTAL<span class="No-break">A/0</span>3_emtalatag.asp</a>. </p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"></a>EMTALA Compliance <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Hospitals should adopt a hospital-wide policy that commits the facility to comply with EMTALA, as well as quality improvement, risk management and corporate compliance programs to monitor adherence with EMTALA standards. A model policy is included as Appendix O. Other recommended EMTALA policies are discussed throughout this manual and are listed in Appendix N. </p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker014"></a>State Laws <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The EMTALA statute expressly provides that the federal obligations do not preempt state and local emergency laws unless they conflict with the EMTALA obligations. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Some states have adopted emergency services statutes or regulations. Readers of this manual should consult with their legal counsel as to the effect of these laws. (Relevant California laws are discussed in this manual.) </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">In 1987, the California Legislature amended the hospital licensing laws to enact state patient anti-dumping laws. The California emergency medical service requirements are similar to EMTALA requirements, with some exceptions that are discussed in this manual. The following are some examples: </p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">California law applies to hospitals that are licensed to provide emergency services; EMTALA applies to all hospitals that provide emergency services, even if they do not have licensed emergency departments. </li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">California law expressly prohibits <a id="_idIndexMarker015"></a>discrimination in the provision of emergency services by hospitals and physicians. </li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">EMTALA focuses on whether a patient with an emergency condition is “stabilized” for transfer or discharge; California law primarily focuses on transfers that are made for nonmedical reasons (e.g., insurance or financial reasons), which apply to patients with emergency conditions that are considered to be stabilized. California law does not apply to a transfer that is made for medical reasons (although other state requirements pertaining to the transfer of patients may apply). </li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The California licensing laws on “emergency services and care” are included as Appendix D. </p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The EMTALA regulations contain a series of defined terms that are essential to the regulatory scheme. The key terms defined below are based on definitions in the EMTALA statute or regulations, except for a number of terms defined by California law that are so indicated. Readers of this manual in other states should consult with their legal counsel as to state laws and regulations that define other terms that are applicable to emergency services rendered in their state. </p>

						<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor002"></a>Emtala Overview And History  <ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor003"></a>The EMTALA Statute  <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) was enacted by Congress as a part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 to ensure access to emergency services. The statute was amended in 1988, 1989, 2003 and 2011. EMTALA applies to anyone who presents for emergency services to a hospital that participates in the Medicare program (including psychiatric hospitals). The EMTALA statute is included as Appendix A. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">EMTALA was enacted in response to studies that found that indigent emergency patients had been turned away from hospitals for necessary services or transferred (i.e., “dumped”) to public and charity hospitals in an unstabilized condition. Although EMTALA was passed to mandate access to emergency services by the indigent, Congress applied the EMTALA requirements to all patients regardless of financial or insurance status. In general, both the federal regulatory agencies and the courts have defined the primary objectives of EMTALA as twofold: to enhance access by all persons to emergency services and to prohibit <a id="_idIndexMarker000"></a>discrimination in the provision of emergency services to persons presenting with the same or similar types of conditions. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"></a>The EMTALA Regulations <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The initial EMTALA regulations were published in draft form in 1988, and issued as interim final regulations on June 22, 1994. On April 7, 2000, the regulations were amended to apply the EMTALA obligations to off-campus hospital services. In September 2003, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (<a id="_idIndexMarker001"></a>CMS) published further changes to the EMTALA regulations, repealing part of the 2000 regulations and clarifying the application of EMTALA to emergency patients, outpatients and inpatients. Since 2004, CMS has amended the EMTALA regulations in piecemeal fashion in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. The current regulations are included as Appendix B. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>The EMTALA <span class="CharOverride-1">Interpretive Guidelines</span> <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker002"></a>CMS has adopted <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> as part of the <span class="Italic">Medicare State Operations Manual</span> to provide guidance for federal and state surveyors in their enforcement of EMTALA. Although the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> are not regulations, they are considered the official interpretation of EMTALA by CMS and are used by California Department of Public Health (CDPH) surveyors and CMS regional offices in enforcement of the EMTALA obligations. The most recent update to the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> was July 16, 2010; the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> are included as Appendix C. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="All-Caps-Bold">Note:</span> The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> are organized by “<a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a>tag numbers,” each of which corresponds to a CMS regulation that establishes the rules for EMTALA. The tag numbers beginning with the letter “A” are applicable to hospitals and the tag numbers beginning with the letter “C” are applicable to <a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a>critical access hospitals. Each tag number has four digits, with the number “2” at the beginning of each tag number. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker005"></a>Special Advisory Bulletins and Other Guidance <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">In November 1999, CMS and the <a id="_idIndexMarker006"></a>Office of Inspector General (OIG) released a final Special Advisory Bulletin on EMTALA and managed care. The Bulletin discusses the rules on seeking health plan authorization prior to the medical screening examination (which were added to the EMTALA regulations in 2003), dual staffing of emergency departments and recommended patient registration practices to minimize violations of EMTALA. The Bulletin is discussed in chapter 4, “Financial Considerations — EMTALA and Managed Care,” and is included as Appendix H. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">From time to time, CMS issues Program Memoranda on various subjects relating to EMTALA obligations. Most of these memoranda have been incorporated into the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span><span class="Italic"> </span>(Appendix C). This manual includes the latest CMS guidance on critical access hospital on-call compliance with EMTALA (Appendix Y), conflicting payor requirements (Appendix X), and Ebola implications for EMTALA (Appendix AA). These memoranda are also described in detail in applicable chapters of this manual. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>Enforcement and Penalties <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The EMTALA obligations are a condition of the Medicare provider agreement (rather than a Condition of Participation), thereby permitting CMS to terminate a provider upon a confirmed violation of EMTALA. As described in chapter 13, “Regulatory Enforcement of EMTALA,” the federal agencies charged with ensuring EMTALA compliance are CMS and the OIG. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">CMS has the authority to conduct complaint and enforcement surveys for EMTALA compliance, and to terminate a hospital’s Medicare provider agreement upon confirming one or more violations of EMTALA. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Under the EMTALA statute (Appendix A), the OIG has the authority to impose civil money penalties up to $50,000 against hospitals and physicians ($25,000 for hospitals with less than 100 beds), an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r to exclude a hospital or physician from the Medicare and Medicaid programs for violations of EMTALA that are “gross and flagrant or repeated.” In December 2016, the OIG issued final regulations updating the amount of civil money penalties, including EMTALA fines. Effective in 2017, the OIG may now impose civil penalties up to $104,826 against hospitals and physicians ($52,414 for hospitals with less than 100 beds) for an EMTALA violation. The maximum amount of the fines is subject to annual adjustment for inflation. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The regional <a id="_idIndexMarker007"></a>quality improvement organization (QIO) is responsible for assisting CMS and OIG review patient stabilization and other medical matters pertaining to the delivery of emergency care and services. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">For hospitals that have community service obligations under the <a id="_idIndexMarker008"></a>Hill-Burton Act, the <a id="_idIndexMarker009"></a>Office for Civil Rights (OCR) will follow up on violations of EMTALA confirmed by CMS with a request for copies of EMTALA compliance, transfer, admission and other hospital policies.  </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>EMTALA Committees and Reports <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Since 2001, there have been a number of committees and governmental agencies that have issued reports on EMTALA, including reports regarding compliance by hospitals and physicians with EMTALA standards, the enforcement process and the overall effect of the law. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker010"></a>Office of Inspector General </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In January 2001, the OIG released two reports on EMTALA: “Survey of Hospital Emergency Departments” and “The Enforcement Process.” </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIG’s “Survey of Hospital Emergency Departments” made the following findings: </p><ol>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Emergency department personnel are familiar with the EMTALA requirements, but many are unaware of recent policy changes. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Training increases EMTALA familiarity for all staff; unfortunately, on-call specialists and staff in high-volume emergency departments are less likely to receive training. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Hospital staff report that hospitals generally comply with EMTALA, but some express concerns about compliance. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Hospital staff believe that some aspects of EMTALA are unclear or questionable. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Hospital staff believe that while EMTALA may help protect patients, it also may contribute to a hospital’s administrative and financial problems. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Investigations, many of which do not confirm violations, often prompt changes in forms and procedures. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Managed care creates special problems for hospitals in complying with EMTALA. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Hospitals have difficulty staffing on-call panels for some specialists. </li>
					</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIG report made three conclusions: </p><ol>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">CMS should use a variety of methods to communicate important policy changes, including e-mail and the Internet. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">CMS should support legislation that compels managed care plans to reimburse hospitals for EMTALA-related services, including screening exams that do not reveal the presence of an emergency medical condition. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Uncompensated care and on-call panels are very complex problems that may require action at the federal, state and local levels, as well as by private entities. </li>
					</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIG reported that CMS concurred with its recommendations. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In “The Enforcement Process” report, the OIG issued the following findings on the EMTALA enforcement process: </p><ol>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">The EMTALA enforcement process is compromised by long delays and inadequate feedback. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The number of EMTALA investigations and their ultimate disposition vary widely by CMS region and year. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Poor tracking of EMTALA cases impede oversight. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Peer review is not always obtained before CMS considers terminating a hospital for medical reasons. </li>
					</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIG report recommended that CMS increase its oversight of the regional offices, improve collection and access to EMTALA data, ensure that peer review occurs for cases involving medical judgment, and establish an EMTALA technical advisory group. The OIG reported that CMS concurred with its recommendations. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker011"></a>General Accountability Office </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In June 2001, the U.S. General Accountability Office (GAO) released its own report entitled “EMTALA Implementation and Enforcement Issues.” Among other findings, the GAO reported that providers generally support the goals of EMTALA, but are uncertain about the extent of their obligations and have concerns about its effects on emergency care. In Table 1 of the report, the GAO listed seven issues identified as provider uncertainties: </p><ol>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">Scope of the medical screening exam </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Definition of patient stability for transfer </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Obligations for post-hospital care </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List"><a id="_idIndexMarker012"></a>Application of the 250-yard rule </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Obligations related to patients in other hospital departments </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Requirement for on-call coverage </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Compliance with local emergency medical systems for routing of ambulances </li>
					</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The comments by CMS on those issues are addressed in various sections of this manual. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Regarding the enforcement of EMTALA, the GAO reported that most EMTALA violations involve failure to screen, stabilize or transfer appropriately. They noted that although hospitals have concerns about CMS enforcement, CMS usually accepts corrective action plans and rarely terminates hospitals from the Medicare program. Finally, the GAO found that the OIG focuses on future compliance in assessing fines for EMTALA violations, and generally does not pursue a physician in the absence of clearly culpable behavior. The GAO endorsed many of the OIG recommendations in the two earlier reports discussed above. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In April 2009, the GAO issued a report entitled “Hospital Emergency Departments — Crowding Continues to Occur, and Some Patients Wait Longer than Recommended Time Frames.” The report looked at indicators of emergency department crowding, including ambulance diversion, wait times and patient boarding. The report determined that the primary factor for emergency department crowding is the lack of inpatient beds, with the following secondary factors: lack of access to primary care, a shortage of available on-call specialists and difficulties with transferring or discharging psychiatric patients. The report, “GAO-09-347,” can be accessed on the GAO website at <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09347.pdf" target="_system">www.gao.go<span class="No-break">v/n</span>ew.item<span class="No-break">s/</span><span class="No-break">d</span>09347.pdf</a>. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a>EMTALA <a id="_idIndexMarker013"></a>Technical Advisory Group </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In the 2003 Medicare reform legislation, Congress directed the Secretary of HHS to establish a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to solicit advice concerning the EMTALA regulations and enforcement. The Secretary signed the charter establishing the TAG on May 11, 2004; the TAG had a term of 30 months. The TAG was composed of 19 members, including four hospital representatives and seven physicians. The final meeting of the TAG was Sept. 17-18, 2007. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The TAG had the following responsibilities: </p><ol>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">Review the EMTALA regulations; </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Provide advice and recommendations to the Secretary concerning the regulations and their application to hospitals and physicians; </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Solicit comments and recommendations from providers and the public regarding the implementation of the regulations; and </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Disseminate information on the EMTALA regulations to providers and the public. </li>
					</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">During its tenure, the TAG issued seven reports and made several recommendations to CMS, some of which resulted in changes to the regulations and others in updated guidance issued in Program Memoranda. At its final meeting, the TAG adopted a series of recommendations related to accepting hospital obligations, clarification of conditions that constitute an “emergency medical condition,” clarification of the term “stabilization” (including a proposed concept of “temporary stabilization”), and procedures and criteria for transferring patients with stabilized conditions to physician offices for follow-up evaluation and care. It is uncertain whether these recommendations will be accepted by CMS, and if so, whether there will be any changes. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Further information on the TAG, including meeting agendas and reports, is available on the CMS website at <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/EMTALA/03_emtalatag.asp" target="_system">www.cms.hhs.go<span class="No-break">v/E</span>MTAL<span class="No-break">A/0</span>3_emtalatag.asp</a>. </p></li></ol></li>
					<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"></a>EMTALA Compliance <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Hospitals should adopt a hospital-wide policy that commits the facility to comply with EMTALA, as well as quality improvement, risk management and corporate compliance programs to monitor adherence with EMTALA standards. A model policy is included as Appendix O. Other recommended EMTALA policies are discussed throughout this manual and are listed in Appendix N. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker014"></a>State Laws <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The EMTALA statute expressly provides that the federal obligations do not preempt state and local emergency laws unless they conflict with the EMTALA obligations. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Some states have adopted emergency services statutes or regulations. Readers of this manual should consult with their legal counsel as to the effect of these laws. (Relevant California laws are discussed in this manual.) </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">In 1987, the California Legislature amended the hospital licensing laws to enact state patient anti-dumping laws. The California emergency medical service requirements are similar to EMTALA requirements, with some exceptions that are discussed in this manual. The following are some examples: </p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">California law applies to hospitals that are licensed to provide emergency services; EMTALA applies to all hospitals that provide emergency services, even if they do not have licensed emergency departments. </li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">California law expressly prohibits <a id="_idIndexMarker015"></a>discrimination in the provision of emergency services by hospitals and physicians. </li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">EMTALA focuses on whether a patient with an emergency condition is “stabilized” for transfer or discharge; California law primarily focuses on transfers that are made for nonmedical reasons (e.g., insurance or financial reasons), which apply to patients with emergency conditions that are considered to be stabilized. California law does not apply to a transfer that is made for medical reasons (although other state requirements pertaining to the transfer of patients may apply). </li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The California licensing laws on “emergency services and care” are included as Appendix D. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The EMTALA regulations contain a series of defined terms that are essential to the regulatory scheme. The key terms defined below are based on definitions in the EMTALA statute or regulations, except for a number of terms defined by California law that are so indicated. Readers of this manual in other states should consult with their legal counsel as to state laws and regulations that define other terms that are applicable to emergency services rendered in their state. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker016"></a>Definitions <ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker017"></a>Campus of a Hospital <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="Italic">(See </span><a href="EMTALA_Chap1_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor023" data-href="_idTextAnchor023"><span class="Italic">H.&nbsp;“Hospital Property (also referred to as the “Campus of a Hospital”),” </span></a><span class="Italic">.) </span></p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><span class="Italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"></a></span><span class="Italic"><a id="_idIndexMarker018"></a></span>Capacity <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="Bold">“Capacity”</span> refers to the ability of a hospital to accommodate a transfer patient.
