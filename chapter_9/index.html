				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor002"></a>Overview<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker000"></a>Every hospital must maintain a central log as a condition of its Medicare provider agreement. The central log must record the names of all individuals who come to the dedicated emergency department. As described in chapter 2, “When and Where Does EMTALA Begin and End?” EMTALA applies to a person:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Who presents to a dedicated emergency department (on- or off-campus) seeking or needing examination or treatment for a medical condition;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Who presents to a location on hospital property outside of a dedicated emergency department seeking or needing examination or treatment for what may be an emergency medical condition;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">In a hospital-owned ambulance under hospital direction; or</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">In a nonhospital-owned ambulance on hospital property.</li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Hospitals in California must also maintain an “emergency room log” in accordance with licensing requirements for a basic, comprehensive or standby emergency medical service.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The central log is the primary resource used by the licensing surveyors to verify the names of persons who have come to a hospital for emergency services, and to select patient medical records for review during EMTALA compliance surveys.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> The failure to enter patient information or maintain the central log is grounds for an EMTALA violation and the termination of the hospital’s Medicare provider agreement. Hospitals should have quality assurance/performance improvement measures in place to ensure that the required information is recorded   in the central log, especially patient disposition for patients who presented to the emergency department but were admitted or treated and discharged from other areas of the hospital.</p>

				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor003"></a>Questions<ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"></a>What information must be contained in the central log?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The central log must list the name of each person who comes to the dedicated emergency department (as described above). The log must also state whether a patient:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">Refused treatment;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">Was refused treatment by the hospital;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">Was transferred;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">Was admitted and treated;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">Was stabilized and transferred; or</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">Was discharged.</li></ol></li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The emergency room log required by California licensing regulations must include, at a minimum:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">The name of the patient;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The date, time and means of arrival;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The age and sex of the patient;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The record number of the patient;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The nature of the presenting complaint;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The disposition of the patient; and</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The time of departure.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The emergency room log must also include information on persons who are dead upon arrival to the emergency department.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">A hospital may include additional information in the log as it deems appropriate.</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>Can a hospital maintain separate logs?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">A hospital may maintain separate logs in each dedicated emergency department or other location that maintains a central log. Although there is no requirement that completed logs must be filed in a central location, hospitals should consider filing the completed logs in    the medical records department for quick retrieval in the event of an EMTALA enforcement survey. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> permit the central log to be maintained in an electronic format.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a>Which patients must be recorded in the central log?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The central log should be maintained for all patients who present to the hospital (including     all on-campus or off-campus dedicated emergency departments) or other locations on the hospital property for services that are covered by EMTALA. Even if a patient leaves before triage or a medical screening examination, his or her name should be recorded in the central log. At a minimum, every dedicated emergency department of the hospital should maintain    a central log. These departments include the emergency department, labor and delivery service, psychiatric service, urgent care center and other ambulatory departments that meet the definition of a dedicated emergency department <span class="Italic">(see chapter 2, “When and Where Does EMTALA Begin and End?”)</span>.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>Are off-campus departments required to maintain a central log?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The 2003 revisions to the EMTALA regulations eliminated the need for an off-campus hospital department to maintain a central log unless the department is a dedicated emergency department. However, off-campus departments operated by a hospital, other than dedicated emergency departments, are required to provide appraisal and referral services to individuals with emergencies under the Medicare Conditions of Participation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip _idGenParaOverride-6"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> It is recommended that the policies and procedures for these off-site outpatient departments include documentation of the names and disposition of individuals in crisis who present to these departments seeking emergency assistance.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>When must entries in the central log be completed?</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The EMTALA regulations and the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> do not prescribe time limits for the completion of central log entries. However, some hospitals have been cited for not completing their central log entries in a timely fashion. Therefore, each hospital should establish policies for completion of log entries. CMS Region IX has recommended that all log entries be completed within approximately 48 hours of patient discharge from the department maintaining the log. Hospitals should establish procedures to verify the timely completion of log entries.</p>
