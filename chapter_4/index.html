Managed care plans provide coverage for emergency services, but often place limits on services or restrict payment for emergency services. These colliding imperatives have resulted in efforts by the federal and state governments to increase access to emergency services by patients covered by <a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a>managed care plans, place limits on the ability of health plans to require prior authorization or control the provision of emergency services, and sanction hospitals for treating managed care patients in any manner different from other emergency patients.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Under the EMTALA regulations, a hospital may not delay providing a medical screening examination (MSE) or other emergency services in order to inquire about an individual’s method of payment or insurance status. In 1999, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) published a Special Advisory Bulletin (see Appendix H) to address the application of the EMTALA obligations to the provision of emergency services to managed care patients. In the 2003 revised EMTALA regulations, CMS adopted guidance set forth in the Special Advisory Bulletin prohibiting hospitals from seeking prior authorization for screening or stabilization services until the hospital has provided the MSE and initiated further examination and stabilizing treatment.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The primacy of EMTALA over managed care is emphasized in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-2">If an individual seeking care is a member of a managed care plan…the hospital is obligated to comply with the requirements of [EMTALA] regardless of the individual’s payor source or financial status. The hospitals [sic] is obligated to provide the services necessary to determine if an [emergency medical condition] is present and provide stabilizing treatment if indicated. This is true regardless if the individual is enrolled in a managed care plan that restricts the enrollee’s choice of health care provider. EMTALA is a requirement imposed  on hospitals, and the fact that an individual who comes to the hospital is enrolled in a managed care plan that does not contract with that hospital has no bearing on the obligation of the hospital to conduct an MSE and to at lease [sic] initiate stabilizing treatment. A managed health care plan may only state the services for which it will pay or decline payment, but that does not excuse the hospital from compliance with EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">In 2013, CMS issued a Survey and Certification letter (Appendix X) that reinforced the requirement for all Medicare-participating hospitals and critical access hospitals to comply with EMTALA, regardless of any conflicting requirements of third-party payors.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Some states have adopted laws providing for access to emergency services. For example, California law requires that emergency services must be provided without first questioning a patient’s ability to pay. California has also adopted several laws related to managed care and emergency services, including post-stabilization services.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor003"></a>Questions<ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"></a> When can a hospital request information on a patient’s financial or insurance status?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The federal EMTALA and state laws on financial and insurance inquiries for emergency patients are not the same. The EMTALA regulations preclude delays in emergency services to make financial or insurance inquiries, and prohibit actions that discourage patients from remaining for further evaluation or treatment. California law is more restrictive, requiring that emergency services be provided without first questioning the patient’s ability to pay. As discussed below, CMS has warned hospitals that aggressive financial registration practices, including collection of money before examination or treatment, may result in EMTALA sanctions.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>EMTALA Requirements</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">As noted above, the EMTALA regulations provide that a hospital may not delay providing a MSE or other emergency services in order to inquire about an individual’s method of payment or insurance status. In 2003, CMS amended the regulations to clarify that a hospital may follow reasonable registration processes for patients covered by EMTALA. Patient registration may include requests for basic demographic information (such as name, address and other pertinent nonfinancial information). It may also include requests for insurance status and plan membership, as long as the inquiry does not delay the medical screening or treatment.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">CMS and the OIG historically have emphasized that inquiries or use of insurance or economic information that delay the provision of an MSE or necessary stabilizing treatment are  prohibited under EMTALA. As stated in the EMTALA regulations, “Reasonable registration processes may not unduly discourage individuals from remaining for further evaluation.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In addition, the 1999 Special Advisory Bulletin recommends that, prior to performing the MSE or commencing stabilized treatment, a hospital should not ask a patient to complete financial responsibility or Advance Beneficiary Notice of Noncoverage (ABN) forms or ask patients for co-payments for services (see Appendix H).</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">As discussed below, the EMTALA regulations were amended in 2003 to incorporate prior CMS guidance that a hospital may not seek prior authorization before the MSE or commencement of stabilizing treatment for an emergency medical condition (EMC). Although a managed care plan may inform the hospital, physician or the patient that coverage will not be provided, the denial of coverage does not affect a hospital’s obligations under EMTALA to screen the patient and provide necessary stabilizing treatment for an EMC.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In May 2012, CMS notified the major hospital associations of its concern with respect to “aggressive debt collection activities” that may have occurred in some hospitals. The CMS letter cited a specific allegation that a hospital may have tried to collect money from emergency patients before they were examined or received necessary treatments. The letter also stated:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">We would have serious concerns with the legality of any hospital policy or procedure that may discourage individuals from seeking emergency care, such as demanding that emergency department patients pay before receiving treatment. Our priority must be to ensure that hospitals do not delay screening exams or stabilizing treatment for patients in order to inquire about an individual’s method of payment or insurance status. (Letter dated May 9, 2012, from Marilyn Tavenner, Interim Administrator of CMS.)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In a subsequent EMTALA survey, CMS cited a hospital for failing to use a reasonable registration process. The survey report included an allegation that patients were asked to  pay copayments, co-insurance or past due amounts during the same time that they were still receiving medical screening and treatment services. The report also stated that patients were advised of the cost of care that had already been incurred prior to completion of services, which resulted in one patient declining a recommended overnight admission to the hospital  for further monitoring and observation of her condition. Several of the allegations were also  the subject of a separate survey under the Medicare Conditions of Participation for patient rights.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In December 2013, CMS issued Survey and Certification Memorandum 14-06: EMTALA Requirements &amp; Conflicting Payor Requirements or Collection Practices (Dec. 13, 2013) (Appendix X) in response to the hospital debt collection activities it was observing. The guidance reiterated that “[a] request to an individual to make immediate payment for services required under EMTALA while such required services are being provided does not fall under either of the permitted exceptions” to the general prohibition on inquiring about method of payment or insurance status. CMS also reinforced the idea that</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">“[a] request by the hospital for immediate payment by an individual who is protected under EMTALA goes well beyond a mere inquiry about payment method. Furthermore, a request for immediate payment risks creating the appearance that the hospital is linking provision of services required under EMTALA to the individual’s ability to pay.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a>State Requirements</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The California hospital licensing laws provide that emergency services and care must be provided without first questioning the patient’s ability to pay. As described in chapter 1, “Overview of Patient-Dumping Laws,” the term “emergency services and care” includes the MSE and necessary stabilizing treatment for patients who have an EMC.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>&#9;References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-5">42 C.F.R.

Moreover, the OIG and [CMS] believe that in the absence of an initial screening, the decision of a managed care plan regarding the need for treatment is likely to be ill-informed.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">OIG has previously stated that it will seek civil money penalties in cases demonstrating a pattern of patients leaving the hospital after triage, but prior to the MSE if the hospital has requested prior authorization for emergency services. A representative of OIG has stated that the office will consider the routine seeking of prior authorization before screening as an aggravating circumstance, that is, a condition that may increase the cost of settlement or civil money penalties.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker005"></a>When can the emergency physician contact the patient’s physician to discuss the patient’s course of treatment?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In the Special Advisory Bulletin (Appendix H), CMS and OIG clarified the ability of the treating physician to call the patient’s physician at any time for clinical reasons. This guidance was subsequently codified in the EMTALA regulations:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">An emergency physician or nonphysician practitioner is not precluded from contacting the individual’s physician at any time to seek advice regarding the individual’s medical history and needs that may be relevant to the medical treatment and screening of the patient, as long as this consultation does not inappropriately delay services required under paragraph (a) [medical screening] and paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) [stabilization, transfer or inpatient admission].</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">It should be noted that the broad language in the regulation suggests that the emergency physician should be able to contact any physician who can provide clinical information that will assist in providing emergency services to the patient.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In its 2013 guidance (Appendix X), CMS noted its concern with payors requiring a secondary evaluation and approval before an individual with an EMC is admitted as an inpatient or transferred to another facility, including payors directing that individuals are transferred to a specific facility. If the individual’s condition is not stabilized, payor intervention in an admission or transfer decision could place the hospital at risk for an EMTALA violation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Hospitals should expect that CMS and OIG will closely scrutinize discussions with a patient’s physician (especially a gatekeeper or other managed care physician) to determine whether they are clinical or financial in nature. If an off-site physician provides necessary clinical information and other assistance to the treating physician, those discussions will be viewed  as enhancing the quality or continuity of medical services, and therefore will not result in an EMTALA violation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">On the other hand, if the off-site physician attempts to limit or deny necessary emergency services for the patient or influence the treating physician to transfer or discharge the patient, CMS or OIG may later take the position that any subsequent action taken by the hospital or the treating physician to discharge the patient was tainted by the directions of  the off-site physician. As noted in footnote 4 of the Special Advisory Bulletin, if the managed care physician requests that the patient be transferred, the treating physician must provide medical screening and necessary stabilizing treatment, and if the patient is not stable, effectuate an appropriate transfer only if there is a medical necessity or an informed patient request for the transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">As discussed below, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> and the Medicare Advantage regulations provide that the judgment of the treating physician takes precedence over the judgment of an off-site physician or the patient’s health plan.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip _idGenParaOverride-7"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> Hospitals should conduct in-service education for emergency physicians, nurses and other staff who may contact attending staff or managed care plans in the course of an emergency visit. The program should review the limitations on seeking prior authorization and the implications of relying on orders or directions from off-site physicians or health plan personnel for patient care or disposition. As appropriate, quality improvement reviews should include cases involving contacts with attending staff or managed care plans prior to the MSE or the commencement of stabilizing treatment.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>&#9;References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-5">42 C.F.R.

This staff member also should be knowledgeable about the hospital’s anti-dumping statute obligations and should clearly inform the patient that, notwithstanding the patient’s ability to pay, the hospital stands ready and willing to provide a medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment, if necessary. Hospital staff should encourage any patient who believes that he or she may have an emergency medical condition to remain for the medical screening examination and any necessary stabilizing treatment. Staff should also encourage the patient to defer further discussion of financial responsibility issues if possible, until <span class="CharOverride-3">after</span> the medical screening has been performed. (Emphasis in original.)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">If a patient asks the hospital if it accepts his or her health plan, the hospital should respond  to the patient. If the patient is not a member of a health plan that contracts with the hospital, the hospital should reaffirm (and document) its offer to provide a MSE, and it should take reasonable steps to encourage the patient to remain for the examination. A number of hospitals have been cited by CMS or OIG for EMTALA violations when a patient leaves the hospital prior to the MSE after learning that the facility does not contract with his or her health plan.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip _idGenParaOverride-7"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> In order to respond to the presumption usually held by the enforcement agencies that the patient left or was turned away for financial reasons, hospital staff should document any information that they have regarding financial or health plan discussions with the patient, the offer to provide the MSE and the reasons for the patient leaving the facility. If the patient elopes or fails to give his or her reasons for leaving, the hospital should consider a follow-up call to the patient to ascertain the reasons for leaving and the health care status of the patient.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a>What if the patient offers a required co-payment before medical screening? <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Many patients routinely offer the co-payment during the registration process prior to receiving a MSE. Although the Special Advisory Bulletin did not specifically address collection of co-payments prior to medical screening, it advised that a “best practice” was not to obtain an individual’s agreement for payment before stabilization. This suggests that co-payments should not be solicited or collected from the patient before the MSE has been completed.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">If a patient offers a co-payment and insists that he or she does not want to defer its collection until after emergency services are rendered, then registration should note that the patient voluntarily offered the co-payment.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 ParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker006"></a>When should <a id="_idIndexMarker007"></a>Advance Beneficiary Notices be given to patients seeking emergency services?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-8">An Advance Beneficiary Notice of Noncoverage (ABN) is a Medicare-required written notice (CMS R-131) to a Medicare beneficiary that payment for services from a hospital or physician may be denied. The notice must be given to the beneficiary before the services are rendered in order to afford the beneficiary the opportunity to refuse the service.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-8">In response to inquiries from providers about giving ABNs to patients coming to the emergency department, CMS has indicated that emergency patients should not be given an ABN before the MSE and a determination is made that the patient does not have an EMC  or any emergency condition is stabilized. As explained by CMS in a prior posting on the Medicare Learning Network:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-9">The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has engaged physicians and their professional organizations in conversations surrounding the perceived conflict between EMTALA requirements and Advance Beneficiary Notice (ABN) instructions. Other than possible problems due to coding conventions … this problem seems to be more one of confusion than of real conflict. EMTALA  does not prohibit asking payment questions entirely, rather, only doing so before screening/stabilization. After screening/stabilization, EMTALA no longer applies and ABNs may be given. Under CMS policy, an ABN should not be given to any patient under great duress, which includes patients seeking emergency services before they are stabilized. Nothing in CMS policy prohibits giving ABNs, when otherwise appropriate, to patients who come to emergency care settings after they have received a medical screening examination and are stabilized.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"></a>What are the Knox-Keene requirements for emergency services?<span class="CharOverride-4"><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap4_rebuild.html#footnote-000">1</a></span></span><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idIndexMarker008"></a>In California, the Knox-Keene Act governs the licensing of managed care plans.

			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker009"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker010"></a>Prior Authorization Before Rendering Emergency Services</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Under the Knox-Keene Act, a health plan or an independent practice association (IPA) may not require a hospital to obtain authorization prior to providing emergency services and care. Health plans and IPAs may require a hospital to obtain prior authorization for care provided after the patient is stabilized.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"></a>Prior Authorization for <a id="_idIndexMarker011"></a>Post-Stabilization Services</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">A health plan or IPA that requires prior authorization must provide 24-hour access for enrollees and providers to obtain timely authorization for medically necessary care to be provided to an enrollee who has received emergency services and is stabilized, but the treating provider believes the patient may not be transferred or discharged safely. If the prior authorization requirement involves a determination of whether the post-stabilization services are medically necessary, a request for authorization must be reviewed and processed in accordance with written criteria and guidelines that are supported by clinical principles and processes.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">A decision to approve or deny authorization must be made in a timely fashion, in light of the enrollee’s medical condition. For example, decisions must be made within five business days in all cases, or within 72 hours if the enrollee faces an imminent and serious threat to his or her health. Generally, a timely decision for a patient who is stable for transfer but requires an inpatient admission or transfer to a higher level of care for follow-up care should be shorter (perhaps hours), depending on the circumstances.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The plan must make a physician available for consultation and resolving disputed requests  for authorization. These requirements do not apply to a health plan that does not require prior   authorization as a prerequisite for payment of necessary medical care following stabilization  of an EMC. Existing regulations require the plan to respond to the provider’s request for authorization to provide post-stabilization care within 30 minutes of the request. The failure of a health plan to meet this requirement is deemed to constitute authorization for the follow-up medical care to the patient.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"></a>Request for Post-Stabilization Services</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text"><span class="All-Caps-Bold">Note:</span> The following discussion applies only to post-stabilization services that are provided by a noncontracting hospital to a patient who is a member of a health plan that requires authorization for post-stabilization services and maintains 24-hour access for patients and providers (including noncontracting hospitals) to obtain timely authorization for medically necessary post-stabilization services. This discussion does not apply to emergency services provided to a patient who is still covered by the EMTALA obligations (i.e., the patient has an EMC that is not stabilized).</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Pursuant to revisions to the California hospital licensing laws effective Jan. 1, 2009, if a patient with an EMC who is a member of a health plan that requires prior authorization for post-stabilization services (i.e., medically necessary care provided after the patient’s EMC is stabilized) presents to a noncontracting hospital, the hospital, with the exception of certain minor procedures described below, must do all of the following before initiating post- stablization services:</p>

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Indent-1 ParaOverride-6">You have received emergency care at a hospital that is not a part of your health plan’s provider network. Under state law, emergency care must be paid by your health plan no matter where you get that care. The doctor who is caring for you has decided that you may be safely moved to another hospital for the additional care you need. Because you no longer need emergency care, your health plan has not authorized further care at this hospital. Your health plan has arranged for you to be moved to a hospital that is in your health plan’s provider network.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Indent-1 ParaOverride-6">If you agree to be moved, your health plan will pay for your care at that hospital. You will only have to pay for your deductible, co-payments, or coinsurance for care. You will not have to pay for your deductible, co-payments, or coinsurance for transportation costs to another hospital that is covered by your health plan.</p>

If the patient or hi<span class="No-break">s/h</span>er legal representative refuses to sign the notice, the hospital must document in the patient record that the notice was provided and the refusal to sign.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"></a>Independent Medical Review</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">An enrollee may request the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) to provide an independent medical review of a health plan’s or IPA’s denial of a claim for urgent or emergency services based in whole or in part on the lack of medical necessity.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As a condition of seeking the review, the enrollee must first give the health plan 30 days to resolve the grievance, or three days to do so if the services have not yet been provided and the enrollee faces an imminent and serious threat to his or her health (such as severe pain, potential loss of life, limb or major bodily function). Hospitals and other providers are not authorized to initiate the independent medical review process, but they may join with or assist the enrollee in pursuing medical review and may act as the enrollee’s advocate.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"></a>Strategies for Obtaining Authorization and Payment</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Although there are no surefire methods to ensure that hospitals and physicians receive authorization an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r payment in a timely manner for rendering post-stabilization care, the following measures are suggested.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Reinforce Member Responsibility</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Hospitals should review their admission practices and forms to ensure that they obtain an appropriate acknowledgment and agreement of financial responsibility for each patient. If the hospital does not contract with the patient’s health plan, the acknowledgment should include the patient’s agreement to accept financial liability for the hospital charges that the health plan or IPA refuses to pay. If the hospital contracts with the patient’s health plan, the plan contract will address the circumstances in which the patient is responsible for the hospital’s charges. In most cases, the patient should acknowledge that he or she will pay for services that the health plan or IPA refuses to authorize, but which the patient requests be provided, as well as emergency services if the health plan or IPA later determines that the enrollee did not have an EMC.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Pursue Member Responsibility</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The Knox-Keene Act contains more provisions protecting enrollees than provisions protecting providers. The DMHC does not have the power to resolve disputes between providers and plans (e.g., to order a health plan to pay a particular claim). However, the DMHC has the power to review and resolve grievances made by enrollees.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Moreover, if the grievance pertains to a denial based on medical necessity, the DMHC has the final authority to resolve the grievance. In consideration of hospital billing and collection practices, noncontracting hospitals may in some instances be able to pursue a health plan enrollee under his or her acknowledgment of financial responsibility in order to encourage the enrollee to submit a grievance to the health plan an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r the DMHC. Once a grievance is initiated, the hospital may participate in the grievance review an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r independent medical review process.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Make Timely Requests for </span><span class="Bold"><a id="_idIndexMarker015"></a></span><span class="Bold">Prior Authorization</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Hospitals should review their internal procedures for determining the need for prior authorization, and then seek any necessary authorization at the appropriate time during the patient’s course of treatment. If a patient presents to the hospital with an EMC, emergency services and care may be provided without authorization; however, authorization should be obtained before proceeding with post- stabilization care. If a patient is determined by the MSE not to have an EMC, then authorization should be obtained prior to proceeding to provide follow-up care for the patient (unless the patient’s condition destabilizes before authorization is obtained).</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Patient is Unstable for Transfer</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If a receiving hospital is requested to accept the transfer of an emergency health plan patient who has an EMC that is not stabilized and needs a higher level of care, the hospital should accept the patient if it has the capacity and capability to provide the services. The hospital should confirm the patient’s unstable condition with the transferring hospital or physician, and make sure that it obtains a copy of the physician’s certification for the transfer. Following the admission of the patient at the receiving hospital, the hospital should seek authorization for services that will be required for the patient after he or she is stabilized. If the health plan or IPA fails or refuses to give an authorization for post- stabilization services, the hospital should request that the plan assume responsibility for the patient’s continuing post-stabilization care (which may involve a further transfer to a plan-contracting hospital). As long as the patient is unstable, the hospital should continue to provide stabilizing treatment for the patient, and should not transfer the patient except as the result of an informed request by the patient, medical necessity or other valid clinical reasons.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Patient’s Condition is Stabilized for Transfer</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If a receiving hospital is requested to accept the transfer of a health plan patient whose EMC is stabilized, but the patient needs post-stabilization services at a facility providing a higher level of care, the receiving hospital is not obligated to accept the transfer unless it has a legal or contractual obligation to do so (see chapter 7, “Obligations of Receiving Hospitals”). The hospital should confirm with the transferring hospital or physician that the patient’s EMC is stabilized. The hospital may then advise the transferring hospital that is willing to admit and treat the patient, subject to obtaining prior authorization for the post-stabilization services.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Consistent with its EMTALA obligations, the receiving hospital should inform the transferring hospital that, if the patient’s condition destabilizes while it is seeking prior authorization, the transferring hospital should immediately call the receiving hospital to arrange for the transfer without waiting for the authorization to be received. Assuming that the patient’s condition remains stabilized and authorization is obtained, the hospital may accept the transfer and provide the authorized services to the patient. If the patient later requires services that exceed the scope of the authorization, the hospital should follow the process discussed above for obtaining further authorization or request that the health plan or IPA assume responsibility for providing the additional treatment required for the patient.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Require Health Plans and IPAs to Assume Responsibility</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As discussed above, if a health plan or IPA does not grant authorization for post-stabilization services within a reasonable period of time, the hospital should request (or if necessary, demand) that the health plan or IPA assume responsibility for the enrollee’s plan (such as arranging for a transfer if medically appropriate).</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Pursue Dispute Resolution Opportunities</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">To the extent feasible and prudent, a hospital should submit inappropriate denials to the health plan’s dispute resolution process.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Pursue Contract Remedies</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Hospitals that contract with a health plan that has denied authorization or payment should review its contract with the plan to determine its contractual remedies that are in addition to its legal remedies.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Report Unfair Payment Patterns to DMHC</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Health plans are prohibited from engaging in “unfair payment patterns.” If a hospital believes that a health plan is engaged in a “demonstrable and unjust pattern…of…denying complete and accurate claims” within a reasonable time, the hospital may report the unfair payment pattern to the DMHC Office of Plan and Provider Relations. The Office may be contacted at 877-525-1295 or providers@dmhc.ca.gov. Although the DMHC cannot order payment to a provider, it can impose administrative sanctions on the health plan.</p>

The final regulations for Medicare Advantage plans include “urgently needed services” in the list of covered services for enrollees. Pertinent provisions of the Medicare Advantage regulations are included in Appendix G.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The Medicare Advantage regulations use the following defined terms:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-10"><span class="Bold">“Emergency services”</span> are defined as covered inpatient and outpatient services furnished by a provider qualified to provide emergency services that are needed to evaluate or stabilize an emergency medical condition.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-10"><span class="Bold">“Emergency medical condition”</span> has the same definition in the EMTALA regulations, with two exceptions. First, the definition does not specifically include psychiatric and chemical-dependency emergencies. Second, the determination of an “emergency medical condition” must be made from the viewpoint of “a prudent layperson, with an average knowledge of health and medicine.”</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-10"><span class="Bold">“Urgently needed services”</span> are:<p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-12">Covered services that are not emergency services … provided when an enrollee is temporarily absent from the MA plan’s service (or if applicable, continuation) area (or, under unusual and extraordinary circumstances, provided when the enrollee is in the service or continuation areas but the organization’s provider network is temporarily unavailable or inaccessible) when such services are medically necessary and immediately required – (A) As a result of an unforeseen illness, injury, or condition; and (B) It was not reasonable given the circumstances to obtain the services through the organization offering the MA plan.</p></li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Under the Medicare Advantage regulations, plans are financially responsible for emergency and urgently needed services:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-4">Regardless of whether they are obtained within or outside of the organization;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Without prior authorization;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">In accordance with the prudent layperson definition of “emergency medical condition” regardless of final diagnosis;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">For which a plan provider or other plan organization representative instructs an enrollee to seek emergency services within or outside the plan; and</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">With a limit on charges to enrollees for emergency services of the lesser of $50 or what it would charge the enrollee if he or she obtained the services through the plan. The regulations provide that the treating physician must decide when the enrollee is considered stabilized for transfer or discharge, and that his or her decision is binding on the plan.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The regulations prohibit plans from limiting access to emergency services. A plan cannot include instructions to seek prior authorization for emergency or urgently needed services in materials furnished to enrollees (including wallet cards). Enrollees must also be informed of their right to call 9-1-1. In addition, plans cannot instruct providers (in materials or contracts) to seek prior authorization before an enrollee has been stabilized.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The regulations also establish standards for plan financial responsibility of “post-stabilization care.” A plan is financially responsible for “post-stabilization care” if:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-4">The services are approved by the plan or a plan provider;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The services are rendered to maintain stabilization within one hour of a request for pre-approval of further post-stabilization services;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The services are rendered without authorization if to maintain, improve or resolve the enrollee’s stabilized condition; and:<ol><li class="Body-Styles_Alpha-list _idGenParaOverride-11">The plan cannot be contacted;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Alpha-list _idGenParaOverride-11">The plan does not respond within one hour to a request for pre-approval; or</li><li class="Body-Styles_Alpha-list _idGenParaOverride-11">The plan and the treating physician cannot reach agreement for the enrollee’s care and a plan physician is not available for consultation.</li></ol></li>
