California has enacted similar requirements that apply to hospitals with licensed emergency departments. Congress has adopted legislation that authorizes the federal government to reduce or waive compliance with certain EMTALA requirements during a national emergency for hospitals covered by the waiver that meet certain requirements.</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor003"></a>Federal Provisions to Waive EMTALA Sanctions<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In 2002, Congress enacted the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 that authorized the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to waive EMTALA sanctions for an inappropriate transfer of an individual with an unstabilized emergency medical condition (EMC) during a public health emergency (as defined in a Presidential declaration). In response to the Congressional authorization, HHS adopted amendments to the EMTALA regulations in 2003 that precluded the imposition of sanctions for an inappropriate transfer during a national emergency by a hospital located in an emergency area.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-2"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>&#9;References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-3">Pub.

The expanded authority permitted the Secretary of HHS to temporarily waive or modify the application of EMTALA standards pertaining to the transfer of an individual who has not been stabilized to receive medical screening in an alternate location if the transfer is required by the circumstances of a declared emergency in the emergency area during the emergency period in accordance with an appropriate state emergency preparedness plan.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-2"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>&#9;Reference:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-3">Pub.

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Thus, effective Oct. 1, 2009, EMTALA sanctions for an inappropriate transfer or for the direction or relocation of an individual to receive medical screening at an alternate location during the period of a waiver issued by HHS will not apply to a hospital if all the following conditions are met:</p>

Similar to the emergency waiver, the pandemic waiver may be terminated earlier if the state emergency pandemic preparedness plan is deactivated before the expiration of the hospital pandemic waiver. In addition, CMS may terminate the pandemic waiver for a specific hospital or group of hospitals before the termination of the public health emergency if there is a determination that the pandemic waiver is no longer necessary for the affected hospitals.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>Effect of an EMTALA Waiver<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">If a waiver is issued by HHS, hospitals in the emergency area must continue to meet all EMTALA requirements except for the obligations that are excused or suspended under the terms of the waiver. As discussed below, the language of the waiver authority is critically important in determining the specific requirements that are suspended during the period of the emergency, and in determining which hospitals within an emergency area are covered by the waiver.</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Medical Screening<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Hospitals should review very carefully the scope of the waiver and their state emergency preparedness plan, and consult with legal counsel as necessary. Within the capacity of the hospital, the review should consider:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Whether the waiver covers the hospital;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">If the waiver covers the hospital, does it permit the hospital to redirect or relocate all patients (such as in an earthquake or other natural disaster) who present for emergency services to other facilities that are designated by state or local health officers for medical screening and examination; or</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Does the waiver permit the hospital to redirect or relocate only those patients whose presenting complaints relate to the national emergency (e.g., patients presenting with pandemic flu symptoms or victims of bioterrorism) to other designated facilities while still providing medical screening to patients whose presenting complaints are unrelated to the emergency (such as women in labor or patients with psychiatric emergencies)?</li></ol></li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As explained in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, CMS expects that in all cases, persons who are protected under EMTALA will receive appropriate medical screening examinations somewhere, even if not at the hospital to which they present.</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a>Transfers<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The wording of the waiver with respect to transfers should also be reviewed very closely. For example, the Katrina waiver lifted the obligation to make an appropriate transfer if the transfer was required by the circumstances of the declared emergency. However, even if the transfer falls within the scope of the waiver and the hospital is excused from meeting the technical requirements of EMTALA, the hospital should make reasonable efforts to explain the need for the transfer to the patient and provide, under the circumstances, any available assistance to facilitate the transfer. Similar to the expectations for medical screening, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> indicate the expectation of CMS that all persons with EMCs who are transferred will be routed to facilities that are capable of providing stabilizing services.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a>Other Obligations<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The scope of the statutory authorization to waive EMTALA requirements is limited to medical screening (which, as noted above, may be limited or broad in scope) and transfers required by the emergent situation. Therefore, other obligations (such as on-call, central log, etc.) may be in force during an emergency. In this regard, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> reinforce that the obligation to accept the transfer of individuals with EMCs is not waived during the declaration of an emergency. Importantly, even if a hospital is covered by a waiver, the hospital is prohibited from discriminating in the provision of all emergency services and care on the basis of an individual’s source of payment or ability to pay. Further, the waiver authority does not eliminate the private right of individuals to bring actions for EMTALA violations (although the effect of the waiver may substantially diminish or even eliminate the likelihood of success of any subsequent litigation alleging an EMTALA violation during a disaster or public health emergency).</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"></a>Hospitals Outside the Designated Emergency Area</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As discussed above, HHS may waive EMTALA requirements for some or all hospitals that are located within an emergency area. However, under the statutory waiver authority and the EMTALA regulations, HHS does not have the authority to reduce or eliminate compliance with the EMTALA obligations for hospitals that are outside of the designated emergency area, even if they serve as catchment facilities for transfers outside of the emergency area. Hospitals outside of the designated emergency area will continue to be subject to EMTALA within their capacity and capability.</p>

				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"></a>Options for Managing Extraordinary Ed <a id="_idIndexMarker002"></a>Surges Without a Waiver<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">On Aug. 14, 2009, CMS issued a Fact Sheet that provides guidance to hospitals with regard to managing extraordinary emergency department surges under existing EMTALA requirements, in the absence of a waiver that covers the hospital. While the Fact Sheet aims to provide guidance to hospitals that are worried about an influenza outbreak, the guidance is also applicable to other public health and emergency situations. CMS suggests three options for hospitals to consider in such situations that meet EMTALA requirements and that do not require a waiver:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">A hospital may set up alternative screening sites on the hospital’s campus. The medical screening examination does not need to take place in the emergency department, and a hospital can set up alternative sites on its campus to perform the screening.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">A hospital may set up screening at off-campus, hospital-controlled sites. Hospitals and community officials can encourage the public to go to these alternate sites instead of the emergency department for screening of certain symptoms (such as flu-like symptoms). However, a hospital cannot tell individuals who have already arrived at the emergency department to go to the off-site location for screening.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">Communities can set up screening clinics at sites that are not under the control of a hospital. These sites are not subject to EMTALA requirements. Hospitals and communities may encourage people to go to these sites instead of the hospital for screening, but a hospital cannot tell individuals who have already arrived at the emergency department to go to the off-site location for screening.</li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> Implementation of the above options may require compliance with hospital disaster and overflow plans established under state licensing requirements, including prior approval of the Licensing and Certification Division of the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Hospitals should check with their local licensing office before establishing special screening sites.</p>

			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In 2014, due to increasing public concerns about Ebola, CMS issued guidance concerning Ebola’s implications for hospital compliance with EMTALA.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"></a>Pre-Hospital Arrangements</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">CMS clarified that pre-hospital arrangements (to bring individuals who meet criteria for a suspected case of Ebola only to hospitals that have been designated to handle potential or confirmed cases) do not present any conflict with EMTALA. This is the case even with hospital-owned ambulances, so long as they are operating in accordance with a community- wide EMS protocol.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"></a>EMTALA Obligations</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">CMS reiterated in its guidance that if an individual comes to the ED, the hospital must provide the individual with an appropriate MSE, notwithstanding any concern that the patient may have Ebola. A refusal to provide an appropriate MSE to anyone who comes to the ED for examination or treatment of a medical condition is a violation of EMTALA. CMS also noted that it violates EMTALA when a hospital uses signage that creates a barrier or prevents individuals who may have been exposed to Ebola from coming to the ED.<span class="CharOverride-3"><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap16_rebuild.html#footnote-000">1</a></span></span> CMS did note, however, that if violations are reported in this context, it will take into consideration the public health directio<span class="No-break">n/d</span>esignation of hospitals as Ebola treatment centers at the time of alleged noncompliance, as well as clinical considerations specific to individual cases.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">CMS also noted that it expects all hospitals and CAHs to provide MSEs and initiate stabilizing treatment, while meeting Ebola isolation requirements and other CDC requirements.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In 2015, CMS published Questions and Answers about EMTALA obligations and Ebola, appropriate transfers under Ebola, state public health agency response frameworks and screening examinations and stabilizing treatment requirements.
