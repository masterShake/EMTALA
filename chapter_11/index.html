				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor002"></a>Overview<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker000"></a>Under EMTALA, a hospital with a dedicated emergency department must maintain a list of physicians who are on call to come to the hospital and provide treatment necessary to stabilize an individual with an emergency medical condition (EMC). Some states, such as California, also have licensing regulations requiring emergency departments to have on-call rosters.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The on-call list must meet the needs of emergency patients in accordance with the resources available to the hospital, including the availability of on-call physicians. The on-call physicians are considered resources available to a dedicated emergency department that must be used to provide emergency services for an individual who has or may have an EMC. Under the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, a hospital is expected to know “prospectively” the identity of its on-call physicians. CMS has also published separate guidance for on-call coverage of critical access hospitals <span class="Italic">(see Appendix Y, discussed under </span><a href="EMTALA_Chap11_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor007"><span class="Italic">D.&#160;“Are there special rules for critical access hospitals?,” page&#160;</span><span class="Italic">11.4</span></a><span class="Italic">)</span>.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> identify three “permitted on-call options” for meeting the coverage obligations:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Coverage physicians may perform elective surgery or other procedures during the period that they are on-call.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Simultaneous call, i.e., a physician may be on-call at the same time at two or more hospitals; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Participation in a formal community call plan that meets certain regulatory criteria. </li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Some states have also adopted regulations that address the requirements for on-call coverage. For example, California law requires hospitals with licensed emergency departments to maintain on-call rosters and have full-time coverage of certain clinical specialties. Additional state requirements apply to hospitals with base-station and trauma designation status. Physicians who serve on call must provide emergency services without regard to a person’s race, color, ethnicity, religion, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, age, sex, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, pre-existing medical condition, physical or mental disability, insurance status, economic status, ability to pay and other categories protected by state law, except where age, sex, pre-existing medical condition or physical or mental disability is medically significant to the provision of appropriate medical care to the patient.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">There have been a number of studies and reports regarding on-call coverage and the changes in physician willingness to accept call obligations. One of the most comprehensive reports was published in 2003 by the California Senate Office of Research with the input of a large, multi-disciplinary task force of physicians, hospitals, health plans, government agencies, consumers and others interested in emergency services. The report, “Stretched Thin: Growing Gaps in California’s Emergency Room Backup System,” is available at <a href="http://sor.senate.ca.gov/sites/sor.senate.ca.gov/files/Stretched%20Thin.pdf">http://sor.senate.ca.go<span class="No-break">v/s</span>ite<span class="No-break">s/s</span>or.senate.ca.go<span class="No-break">v/f</span>ile<span class="No-break">s/S</span>tretched%20Thin.pdf</a>.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text"><span class="All-Caps-Bold">Note:</span> This chapter does not address payment arrangements with physicians for on-call coverage. To date, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) has issued three Advisory Opinions addressing payment to physicians for on-call coverage. The first was issued on Sept. 20, 2007 (Advisory Opinion 07-10); the second was issued on May 14, 2009 (Advisory Opinion 09-05); and the third was issued on Oct. 30, 2012 (Advisory Opinion 12-15, Modification to Advisory Opinion 12-15). The opinions are posted on the OIG website (<a href="http://oig.hhs.gov">http://oig.hhs.gov</a>). Hospitals should consult with their legal counsel to discuss the legal issues surrounding payment arrangements with physicians for on-call coverage.</p>

In the 2009 <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) states that the on-call obligations apply not only to hospitals with dedicated emergency departments, but also to hospitals that must accept appropriate transfers of individuals with EMCs. Effective in 2017, the EMTALA civil money penalties and exclusion regulations were revised to clarify that an on-call physician subject to sanctions includes not only a physician on-call to the treating hospital, but also a physician on-call to a receiving hospital that is requested to accept an appropriate transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>&#9;References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-4">42 C.F.R.

CMS has declined, however, to require that every medical and surgical specialty represented on the hospital medical staff have a call schedule. Under the EMTALA regulations, CMS requires that all hospital departments that are dedicated emergency departments, including labor and delivery, psychiatric services and urgent care centers, should have on-call coverage.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">States may impose additional requirements for on-call coverage. For example, in California:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The hospital licensing regulations require hospitals providing basic 24-hour emergency services to provide on-call coverage for the basic services required for licensure (i.e., radiology, general surgery, pathology, anesthesia and general medicine) and for supplemental services listed on the hospital license (e.g., psychiatry, pediatrics and obstetrics).</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">There are additional on-call requirements for trauma facilities and for hospitals that have contractual arrangements to provide on-call coverage.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">Hospitals operating standby emergency services are required to have a physician on-call at all times to respond within a reasonable time relative to the patient’s illness or injury.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">Basic, comprehensive and standby emergency services are all required to maintain a roster of specialty physicians who are available for consultation at all times. The failure to maintain a roster of on-call physicians has, in least one instance, been held by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) to constitute “immediate jeopardy,” for which administrative sanctions may be imposed.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">An acute psychiatric hospital is required to have a psychiatrist available at all times for psychiatric emergencies.</li></ol></li></ol></li>

				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a>Must all specialties be on call at all times?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> state that hospitals “should strive to provide adequate on-call coverage consistent with the services provided at the hospital and the resources the hospital has available, including the availability of specialists. There is no requirement under the EMTALA regulations that all of the hospital’s clinical specialties be listed on the on-call roster at all times. CMS has explained that it has not set requirements on how frequently physicians are expected to provide on-call coverage. Therefore, except for more extensive requirements under state law (such as full-time on-call coverage for certain professional services that is discussed immediately above), coverage for other specialties that are represented on the hospital medical staff may be full-time or part-time.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">There is no bright-line test under EMTALA for determining when coverage must be full-time for specialties that are not required to have full-time coverage under state law or other contractual obligations. CMS has explicitly rejected the long-standing misconception that call coverage must be full-time if there are three or more physicians in a particular specialty.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Under EMTALA, there are no fixed standards for part-time coverage, including the frequency of coverage by an individual physician (such as three to five days per month) or the periodicity of coverage (consecutive days, weekdays or weekends). These decisions are delegated to each hospital and its medical staff. However, the EMTALA regulations require a hospital to have written policies and procedures for handling emergency patients when a particular specialty is not available.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">As noted above, the primary guidance for on-call coverage is that coverage should be consistent with the hospital’s services and resources, including the availability of on-call physicians.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, CMS lists the following factors that hospitals may consider in establishing the frequency of on-call coverage:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The number of physicians on the medical staff in a specialty;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">Other demands on staff physicians (such as patient care obligations, conferences, vacations, days off and similar factors);</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The frequency with which the hospital’s patients typically require the services of on- call physicians (for example, a hospital should consider the predictable demand for specialty services, such as orthopedic or cardiac emergencies, when scheduling its on-call specialists); and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The provisions that a hospital has made for situations when on-call coverage is unavailable or the physician on-call is unable to respond due to circumstances beyond his or her control.</li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Other factors that should be considered are the representations made by the hospital on its website and in its promotional and educational materials that describe the availability of services at the hospital (especially statements that a particular service is available at all times).</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In addition, in at least one instance, CMS validated an EMTALA violation for failure to provide full-time coverage of a specific clinical specialty based on the review of the hospital’s on-call coverage contracts with specialists on the medical staff. In the statement of deficiencies, CMS noted that the contract provided that the on-call physicians would accept call on a basis that was sufficient to ensure coverage for the specialty seven days a week, including holidays.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">CMS provides another example in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> for assessing the adequacy of on-call coverage:</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style">For instance, if the hospital under investigation performs a significant amount of interventional cardiac catheterizations and holds itself out to the public through various advertising methods as a center of excellence in providing this specialized procedure to the community, it would be reasonable to expect that there would be adequate on-call coverage by a physician who is able to perform an emergent interventional cardiac procedure on individuals who present to that hospital’s DED in need of such an intervention or who are appropriately transferred to that hospital for such an intervention.</p>

				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>Are there special rules for critical access hospitals?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) have greater flexibility for maintaining on-call coverage. Under the Medicare Conditions of Participation (CoP) for a CAH, a physician, PA, NP or a clinical nurse specialist with training or experience in emergency care must be immediately available by telephone or radio, and available on-site within 30 minutes (60 minutes in a frontier area that meets certain conditions). While the CAH is required to have an on-call roster reasonably related to its services and medical staff members, this does not require that the staff physicians must be on-call and available to respond in person at all times, including every case involving an individual with an emergency medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The CAH CoPs require that a physician must be immediately available by telephone or radio contact on a continuous basis to receive emergency calls, provide information on the treatment of emergency patients, and refer patients. CMS guidance issued in 2013 (Appendix Y) indicates that this requirement may be met by a staff physician or a telemedicine physician. CMS does not require that a telemedicine physician must be listed on the on-call roster; in fact, CMS states that it is not advisable to do so.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">However, state laws for emergency services, such as standby emergency services in California, may require that a physician be available at all times to come to the hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>&#9;References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-4">CMS Survey and Certification Memorandum 13-38: Critical Access Hospital Emergency Services and Telemedicine (June 7, 2013) (Appendix Y)</p></li>

For instance, some hospitals may employ the use of “jeopardy” or back-up schedules to be used under extreme circumstances. The hospital must be able to demonstrate that hospital staff is aware of and able to execute the back-up procedures.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>&#9;References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-4">42 C.F.R.

The requirement that the dedicated emergency department must be prospectively aware of which physicians are on call means that a medical specialty or medical group cannot simply list all of its members and request that the emergency physician call the members in order to find an available physician when needed.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-7">In the past, CMS has indicated that it will look at how a hospital meets its on-call responsibilities not only by a review of the on-call roster, but also by the past practices of the physicians who are on call or “available” to the hospital. In the preamble to the 2003 regulations, CMS reiterated that the practice of refusing to be listed on the on-call roster, but taking calls selectively (for example, based on insurance status), “would clearly be a violation of EMTALA” [68 Fed. Reg. 53255]. This policy is reinforced in Interpretive Guidelines. However, if a hospital permits physicians to selectively take call only for their own established patients who present to the ED for evaluation, then the hospital must be careful to assure that it maintains adequate on-call services, and that the selective call policy is not a substitute for the on-call services required by the Medicare provider agreement.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">If a physician has a de facto pattern of accepting on-call responsibilities, an enforcement agency may determine that his or her conduct is tantamount to being on call and hold the hospital responsible for permitting a coverage physician to refuse acceptance of an emergency patient or failing to come to the hospital when requested to do so by an emergency physician.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">One of the continuing issues of on-call coverage is whether a physician must respond to the request of an emergency physician if he or she believes that the emergency patient requires services that are within the scope of his or her clinical privileges but beyond the scope of his or her actual practice (for example, various orthopedic subspecialty procedures). In the preamble to the 2003 regulations, CMS noted that a physician:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-7">who is in a narrow subspecialty may, in fact, be medically competent in his or her general specialty, and in particular may be able to promptly contribute to the individual’s care by bringing skills and expertise that are not available to the emergency physician… [68 Fed.

			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As described in chapter 7, “Obligations of Receiving Hospitals,” if a transferring hospital requests the transfer of an emergency patient with an unstabilized EMC in order to access a higher level of care than the transferring hospital provides, the receiving facility is obligated to accept the transfer unless it does not have the capacity to treat the patient. By extension, a physician on call to the receiving hospital has the same obligation as the hospital to accept a patient with an unstabilized EMC and to come to the hospital to treat the patient. If an on-call physician is available to accept the transfer of an unstabilized emergency patient, the receiving hospital has the capability and capacity to treat the patient, and the transfer is otherwise appropriate under the circumstances, a refusal by the on-call physician to accept the patient may be a violation by the hospital of EMTALA. As noted above, the EMTALA civil money penalties and exclusion regulations were extended in 2017 to apply to physicians on- call to a receiving hospital that are requested to accept an appropriate transfer.</p>

For example, the hospital should adopt a chain of command policy specifying the personnel (such as department or section chair, or the administrator-on-call) to be contacted in the event of an on-call failure.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">If an on-call physician fails to meet his or her obligations under EMTALA or state law, the hospital should consider the following actions:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a>Document in the patient medical record the time of notification of the requested transfer and the request made to the on-call physician, the response time of the physician, and other pertinent information related to the failure of the on-call physician to meet his or her obligations;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">Contact the chief of service or other designated person to enforce the call obligation;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">Contact other staff physicians in the same specialty who may be available to see the patient in a timely manner;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">Contact other area hospitals providing the specialty service to arrange for an appropriate transfer if other qualified physicians are not available to see the patient;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">Transfer the patient in accordance with EMTALA guidelines;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">Document in the medical record the name and address of the on-call physician who refused to consult and examine the patient (this documentation is expressly required by the EMTALA statute); and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">Report the failure to the hospital’s quality improvement and risk management programs, and initiate, where appropriate, a follow-up review of the actions of the on-call physician and the hospital by the medical staff and hospital administration.</li></ol></li></ol></li>

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, CMS notes that if an on-call physician does not fulfill his or her obligation to come to the hospital for an emergency patient, but the hospital arranges for another staff physician to assess the patient (and there are no other EMTALA violations), the hospital will not be cited for the on-call failure. However, the call physician who failed to respond may be in violation of EMTALA.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">However, if the on-call failure results in a transfer of the patient to another facility, then the hospital will be subject to a CMS enforcement action and both the hospital and the on-call physician may be subject to civil money penalties imposed by the OIG. As discussed in chapter 5, “Transferring or Discharging an Emergency Patient,” a hospital transferring a patient due to an on-call failure or refusal to respond must list the name and address of the on-call physician in the patient record that is sent to the receiving facility.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The oversight and enforcement of on-call coverage is a medical staff responsibility. Hospitals should expect that the enforcement agencies will inquire as to whether the medical staff has monitored the compliance of on-call physicians and taken appropriate disciplinary action against an on-call physician who refuses to accept an emergency patient or fails to come to the hospital in a timely manner to provide necessary consultation or other required services for a patient with an EMC.</p>
