				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor003"></a>Questions<ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"></a>What is the deadline for reporting an EMTALA violation?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> state that hospitals are required to promptly report a suspected violation within 72 hours of the occurrence.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>Where is the report filed?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">A report of a suspected EMTALA violation must be filed with CMS or the state survey agency. In general, the report should be made to the appropriate CMS regional office or the local field office of the state survey agency.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a>What is the penalty for not filing a report?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Under EMTALA, the failure of a receiving hospital to report a suspected EMTALA violation by a transferring hospital is grounds for termination of the receiving hospital’s Medicare provider agreement. CMS has indicated that it will review the actions of all hospitals involved in an EMTALA complaint, and will take action against a receiving facility for failure to report an EMTALA violation. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> require surveyors to “look for evidence” by reviewing medical records or interviewing patients, family members and staff that a receiving hospital knew or suspected that a patient had been transferred in violation of EMTALA standards.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>Are there state reporting requirements?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Some states have adopted additional requirements for reporting patient-dumping violations. For example, California law requires a receiving hospital and its physicians and other licensed emergency care personnel to report apparent violations to CDPH within one week of the occurrence. A transferring hospital and its physicians and other licensed emergency care personnel may report apparent violations to CDPH within one week of the occurrence. The complaint must be forwarded to the transferring hospital and the local emergency medical services agency, unless CDPH concludes that the complaint does not require further investigation, is unmeritorious, or its investigation of the allegations would be impeded by disclosure.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>Is a hospital required to self-report a violation of EMTALA or the state anti- dumping laws?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">There is no requirement under the EMTALA regulations that a hospital must self-report an EMTALA violation that it has or may have committed. State licensing laws (Health and Safety Code Section 1317.4(c)) permit a transferring hospital or its personnel to report an apparent violation to CDPH. As discussed below, hospital personnel or physicians who report a suspected EMTALA or state law violation are protected under anti-retaliation laws.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">If a hospital has identified a potential violation of EMTALA or state emergency laws, the hospital should consider the merits of self-reporting even if a report is not required. In some cases, if a hospital self-reports a violation before a complaint by another hospital or person is filed with CMS or the state survey agency, and the hospital has immediately addressed and appropriately corrected the circumstances that resulted in the violation, CMS may (but is not required to) limit the scope of the EMTALA investigation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In a 2016 Final Rule, the OIG addressed self-reporting as a mitigating factor to reduce the potential amount of civil money penalties for an EMTALA violation. The OIG indicated that taking appropriate and timely corrective action in response to an EMTALA violation would be considered a potential mitigating factor. However, the OIG stated that:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">Mitigating corrective actions must be completed before CMS initiates an investigation of the hospital and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">The hospital must self-report the violation to CMS before CMS receives a complaint about the violation from another source.</li></ol></li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As an example where self-reporting may be appropriate, a hospital self-reported an on-call violation where a specialist refused to come to the emergency department to treat a patient with an emergency medical condition. The hospital reported the circumstances to CMS  and CDPH, along with a timeline of the event and a corrective action plan. CMS limited the survey to the incident and confirmed the violation. In a subsequent investigation, the OIG substantially reduced the civil penalty assessed against the hospital (which would have been much higher had the incident not been self-reported).</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">On the other hand, hospitals should thoroughly review the facts of a suspected violation, and consult with legal counsel as appropriate, before self-reporting a violation. As an example, a hospital self-reported an event as an EMTALA violation that did not even implicate the EMTALA obligations. The follow-up investigation led to a multi-day survey that, through the review of patient records unrelated to the self-reported case, identified not only serious violations in the emergency department, but also in labor and delivery.</p>

				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Is a violation of EMTALA or the state emergency services laws reportable to CDPH as an “adverse event?”<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Effective July 1, 2007, California hospitals must report “adverse events” to CDPH. A violation of EMTALA or the state emergency service laws is not itself a reportable event.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">However, the circumstances surrounding the care provided to a patient who is covered by EMTALA or the state emergency services laws may fall into one of the categories of adverse events that must be reported to CDPH. Hospitals that identify an adverse event, or another circumstance involving an emergency patient, that may be reportable (such as elder or child abuse) should review CHA’s <span class="Italic">Consent Manual</span> or consult with legal counsel.</p></li>

			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As discussed in chapter 13, “Regulatory Enforcement of EMTALA,” EMTALA and some states have adopted laws that prohibit retaliation against personnel or physicians who report an EMTALA or state law violation.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Under EMTALA, a hospital may not penalize or take adverse action against a physician or another qualified professional because that person refused to authorize the transfer of an individual with an emergency medical condition that had not been stabilized.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Some states also have anti-retaliation laws. Under California law, retaliation is prohibited against a physician or emergency personnel for reporting in good faith an apparent violation of the statute, or for refusing to transfer a patient if the physician determined, based on reasonable medical probability, that a transfer would have created a medical hazard. A hospital, government agency or person who violates the state anti-retaliation law for emergency services is subject to a civil money penalty of no more than $10,000 per violation.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In addition, the California hospital licensing laws (Health and Safety Code Section 1278.5) prohibit a hospital from discriminating or retaliating against any patient, employee, medical staff member, or other health care worker for presenting a grievance or complaint, or initiating or cooperating in any governmental investigation or proceeding relating to the care, services, or conditions of that facility. Violations by hospitals are subject to a civil penalty of up to $25,000, and willful violations by an individual are a misdemeanor subject to a fine of up to $75,000, in addition to the civil penalty.</p>
