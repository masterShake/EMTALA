				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor002"></a>Overview<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker000"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker001"></a>EMTALA compliance is a responsibility of the hospital and its medical staff. Each hospital should have a board-approved policy mandating compliance with EMTALA, and making compliance a substantial part of its in-service education, quality improvement and risk management programs. A model hospital policy on compliance with EMTALA is attached as Appendix O of the manual.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">EMTALA should also be part of a hospital’s compliance program. Failure to comply with EMTALA should be viewed as potentially exposing the hospital to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) enforcement action, possible monetary sanctions, patient litigation and adverse publicity. Responding to a CMS enforcement survey is time-consuming, costly and highly disruptive, and often places a high degree of stress on emergency personnel, as well as other departments responsible for ensuring EMTALA compliance.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">CMS and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) are interested in the quality improvement processes used by hospitals to evaluate EMTALA compliance, train personnel and implement corrective action. CMS routinely advises its surveyors to review the quality management process as part of an EMTALA survey. In more than one sanction case, the OIG inquired as to the actions taken by a hospital medical staff to evaluate the failure of an on-call physician to accept a patient. An attorney representing the OIG suggested that action by the medical staff or the hospital to discipline an on-call physician for refusal to accept a call when required to do so would be viewed favorably by the OIG in deciding whether to seek sanctions against the hospital for transferring a patient due to the on-call failure.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor003"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker002"></a>Policies and Procedures<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Quality improvement, risk management and EMTALA compliance start with policies and procedures. Included as Appendix N is a checklist of the types of policies and procedures recommended for EMTALA compliance. Included as Appendix O is a model hospital policy on compliance with EMTALA.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"></a>Internal Monitoring<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Monitoring EMTALA compliance is a responsibility of hospital administration, department heads, the medical staff, quality improvement and risk management. At a minimum, hospitals and their medical staffs should adopt a quality assuranc<span class="No-break">e/p</span>erformance improvement program for monitoring EMTALA compliance, including the conduct of medical screening examinations and sending and receiving patient transfers.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement (QAPI) program should include:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Responsibilities for monitoring;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">A schedule for monitoring activities;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Monitoring tools and surveys used to measure EMTALA compliance;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Thresholds for focused reviews;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Action steps to resolve or correct problems identified by the program; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Communication of monitoring results to hospital medical staff, administration and other affected department heads and facility personnel.</li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Although there is no mandated sample size for reviewing screening and transfer cases, many hospitals review 100 percent of their emergency, labor and psychiatric patient transfers. Sample sizes vary for medical screening due to the volume of emergency visits. A hospital should determine a statistically valid sample size, and re-evaluate the sample size periodically based on the degree of compliance evidenced by the reviews. If certain patterns of noncompliance are discovered, focused reviews in those areas should be added to the screening review. Sample tools for review of patient transfers and medical screening examinations are included as Appendix L.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">A number of hospitals have expanded the scope of their quality assessments. Additional reviews include:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">Transfers received by the hospital;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">All requested transfers to the facility that were denied by the hospital;</li>

				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>In-Service Education<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The key to effective EMTALA compliance is ongoing in-service education for all personnel and physicians involved in emergency patient intake and acceptance, screening, treatment and transfer. For emergency personnel, EMTALA education should be continuous, using formal in-service education programs; periodic meetings to identify, discuss and resolve EMTALA questions and issues or reach consensus on best practices for handling difficult cases or circumstances; and memoranda and other communications to reinforce staff compliance with the EMTALA requirements.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">In-service programs should focus on documentation, including such areas as:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Findings of the triage examination;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Findings of the medical screening examination;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">The offer by the hospital to provide a medical screening examination or further examination or treatment to a patient who refuses the services;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Reasons and circumstances relating to a patient leaving the hospital prior to receiving a medical screening examination;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Reasons and circumstances relating to a patient’s refusal to accept further emergency care;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Assessment of, and response to, individuals seeking or in need of emergency services outside of the main facility building;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Any unusual occurrences relating to access to, or receipt of, emergency services;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Findings from continuous monitoring of an unstabilized patient;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Conversations with on-call physicians;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Actions taken if an on-call physician fails or refuses to respond to call;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Conversations with off-site physicians and managed care plans;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">The patient’s vital signs and health status immediately prior to transfer or discharge (especially for a patient who has, had or was suspected of having, an emergency medical condition);</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Patient’s discharge instructions;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Conversations (including times of calls and names of persons spoken to) relating to transferring a patient to another facility;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Conversations (including times of calls and names of persons spoken to) relating to accepting a patient transfer from another hospital;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Full and accurate completion of patient transfer forms;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">The hospital’s capacity and capability to accept a transfer and, as applicable, the reasons for refusing an appropriate transfer; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Completion of the central log (especially if the patient received care outside of the emergency department and was discharged by another hospital department).</li></ol></li>
