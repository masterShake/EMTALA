				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor002"></a>Overview<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">If an EMTALA patient is determined to have an emergency medical condition (EMC), a   hospital is obligated to provide further examination and necessary stabilizing treatment within the capabilities of the facilities and staff (including on-call physicians) available at the hospital.   If the hospital does not have the capability to provide necessary stabilizing treatment, or upon an informed request by the patient, the hospital must make an appropriate transfer of the patient to another facility. In addition, if a hospital has exhausted its capability or is operating beyond its capacity, an appropriate transfer must be made if the EMC is not stabilized.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">An emergency patient who has an unstabilized EMC may be transferred only if one of two conditions is present:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">The patient makes an informed request for the transfer; or</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker000"></a>The transfer is for medical reasons and the transferring physician certifies that  the medical benefits reasonably expected from treatment at the receiving facility outweigh the increased risks to the patient from the transfer.</li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">An appropriate transfer of a patient with an <a id="_idIndexMarker001"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker002"></a>unstabilized EMC must meet four basic criteria:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-3">Provision of treatment within the capacity of the hospital to minimize the risks of the transfer;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Acceptance by a receiving hospital that has available space and qualified personnel to provide treatment to the patient;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Transfer of all medical records related to the EMC; and</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Use of qualified personnel, equipment and transportation to effect the transfer.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In addition, hospitals must <a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a>document a timely reassessment of the patient prior to his or her departure from the hospital.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Hospitals must <a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a>maintain medical and other records related to all patient transfers to or from the hospital for a period of at least five years from the date of transfer. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> indicate that medical records transferred to or from the hospital must be retained in original or legally reproduced form in hard copy, microfilm, microfiche, optical disks, computer disks or computer memory.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">While EMTALA does not address transfers of patients whose EMCs are stabilized, California law establishes standards for transfers of patients with stabilized conditions that are made     for non-medical reasons, such as transfers to health plan contracting hospitals or transfers of patients for financial reasons.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The requirements for receiving hospitals to accept patient transfers are discussed in <span class="No-break">chapter 7</span>, “Obligations of Receiving Hospitals.”</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">At the end of this chapter, there is a discussion of the requirements for discharging a patient from a dedicated emergency department. The discussion includes special requirements for discharging an emergency patient who is homeless.</p>

If a patient has an EMC that has not been “stabilized,” a hospital may not transfer the patient unless either there is an informed patient request or a physician certification for the transfer, and the transfer is implemented in accordance with EMTALA standards that are addressed in <a href="EMTALA_Chap5_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor011">III.&#160;“Standards for Appropriate Transfer,” page&#160;5.5</a>.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>When is an emergency medical condition considered to be “stabilized?” <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The term “stabilized” is one of the most important and most misunderstood words in the EMTALA statute and regulations. An understanding of the meaning of “stabilized” is critical since it determines:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">When a hospital has met its EMTALA obligations to a patient who has an EMC;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">When a hospital must follow the EMTALA standards for making an appropriate transfer of a patient; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">When a receiving hospital must accept, or may refuse to accept, a transfer of a patient with an EMC from another hospital.</li></ol></li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Under the EMTALA regulations, <span class="Bold">“stabilized”</span> means, with respect to an EMC, that no    material deterioration of the patient’s condition is likely, with reasonable medical probability, to result from or occur during the transfer or discharge of the patient from the facility, or that a woman has delivered her child and the placenta. The same definition is also used in California law.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Unfortunately, physicians often use the terms “stabilized” and “stable” interchangeably, which may not always be correct. This sometimes results in confusion on the part of staff at the transferring and receiving facilities regarding when a patient has an EMC that is “stabilized” within the meaning of EMTALA.</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a>If a patient is determined to be “stable,” does that mean that the EMC is stabilized?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">As used by EMTALA, the term “stabilized” has a meaning that differs from the common   use by physicians of the term “stable.” In the St. Anthony Hospital decision <span class="Italic">(see chapter 7, “Obligations of Receiving Hospitals”)</span>, the court noted that the legal definition of “stabilization” in EMTALA is different from the medical use of the term “stable” to denote the status of a patient or hi<span class="No-break">s/h</span>er condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The concern regarding the use of the medical term “stable” is illustrated in a 2013 Survey and Certification Letter issued by CMS (Appendix X). In the letter, CMS cautioned hospitals that  “the statutory definition of an individual’s EMC being ‘stabilized’ does not necessarily equate   to an individual being clinically stable.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-6">The similarity of the terms “clinically stable” and “stabilized” appears to cause confusion among hospitals, practitioners and other hospital staff. It is not uncommon for practitioners to find that an individual has become “clinically stable,” often understood to mean the normalization of the individual’s vital signs, and then conclude that the hospital’s EMTALA obligation has ended. However, if the EMC has not been stabilized, as that term is defined … [by   the EMTALA regulations], EMTALA continues to apply. For example, a patient diagnosed with appendicitis might have relatively normal vital signs, but is still  in need of surgery, and therefore continues to have an EMC that has not been stabilized.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-6">Furthermore, many practitioners and some third-party payors seem to assume that if an individual can withstand the risk of a transfer, then that means the individual has been stabilized and the hospital’s EMTALA obligation has ended. This also is not necessarily the case. This mistaken assumption can be reflected in the commonly used term “stable for transfer.” “Stable for transfer”  is not a term used in EMTALA, and it is not necessarily equivalent to the term “stabilized,” as defined for EMTALA purposes. Use of this term can, therefore, be very misleading.

The revisions to the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> stated that a patient’s EMC is deemed stabilized if the treating physician (or other qualified professional) determines within reasonable clinical confidence that the patient’s EMC has been “resolved.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The term “resolved” does not appear in the EMTALA statute or regulations, and is not defined by CMS in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>. As part of clarifying the meaning of “resolved,” CMS stated that patient stabilization does not require the resolution of the underlying medical condition. As an example, CMS describes a patient with an asthma attack who requires treatment under EMTALA to alleviate the acute respiratory symptoms. After the immediate EMC is resolved, the hospital may discharge the patient, admit the patient or transfer the patient depending on his or her needs (noting that the transfer is not covered by EMTALA because the EMC was resolved). CMS notes that this guidance is a clarification, rather than a change, of policy.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> warn that if there is a dispute between CMS (or a surveyor) as to whether an individual’s EMC is stabilized (or resolved), the burden of proof is the responsibility of the transferring hospital. Surveyors are directed to assess patient stability and refer appropriate cases to the quality improvement organization (QIO) for review.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Despite the effort to develop a clearer meaning of the term “stabilized” or the implications of the term “resolved,” the best guidance offered by CMS is as follows:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-6">If the treating physician is in doubt that an individual’s EMC is stabilized the physician should implement an appropriate transfer … to prevent a potential violation of EMTALA, if his/her hospital cannot provide further stabilizing treatment.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>&#9;References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-7">42 C.F.R.

Since CMS has not adopted separate standards for psychiatric EMCs, the definition of “stabilized” for medical emergencies (i.e., no material deterioration of the condition is likely,  with reasonable medical probability, to result from or occur during the transfer or discharge of  a patient from a facility) also applies to whether a psychiatric EMC is stabilized.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">It is important to keep in mind that there is no distinction under the EMTALA rules between the transfer of an individual with a medical EMC or an individual with a psychiatric EMC. In 2016, OIG settled with Research Medical Center (RMC) of Missouri for $360,000 to resolve RMC’s:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Failure to provide an adequate MSE and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Making an improper transfer of a patient with a psychiatric EMC.</li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The patient arrived at RMC’s ED and, without providing stabilizing treatment, RMC transported the patient to a nearby facility by private vehicle. During transport, the patient exited the vehicle and was struck by another vehicle. In the course of its investigation, OIG found 17 additional occasions where RMC failed to provide adequate MSEs and improperly transferred or discharged patients with psychiatric EMCs, without providing stabilizing treatment. A more detailed discussion of the stabilization and transfer of psychiatric patients is found in chapter 6.</p>

				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Who has the responsibility to determine whether an emergency medical condition is stabilized (or resolved)?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">CMS has reaffirmed that the treating physician has the responsibility to determine whether    an individual has an EMC, whether it is stabilized or resolved, and whether the individual’s condition is stabilized for purposes of transfer or discharge. Therefore, in the event of a disagreement between the treating physician and an off-site physician, the medical judgment of the treating physician will usually take precedence over that of the off-site physician. As noted in chapter 4, “Financial Considerations — EMTALA and Managed Care,” the Medicare Advantage regulations state that the treating physician must decide when the enrollee is considered stabilized for transfer or discharge, and that his or her decision is binding on the plan.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>&#9;References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-7"><span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, tag nos.

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> state that compliance with EMTALA overrules state, regional  and local plans and networks for patient care evaluation and treatment (including trauma networks and psychiatric facilities). Therefore, a hospital must provide a medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment within its capability before the transfer of a patient to a regional facility. A more detailed discussion of regional care networks for the treatment and transfer of psychiatric patients is found in chapter 6.</p>

The certification must include a summary of the risks and benefits upon which it is based.

U.S. HHS</span>, (934 F.2d 1362 (5th Cir. 1991)), the court identified four ways in which a hospital or a physician may violate the certification requirement:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-3">Failure to obtain the physician’s signature on the certification form;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Failure by the physician to deliberate and weigh the medical risks and benefits of the transfer before signing the certification;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Reliance by the physician on an improper consideration as a significant factor in the certification decision; and</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Signing a certification despite a finding that the medical risks outweigh the medical benefits expected from the transfer.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In a 2009 decision, <span class="Italic">Heimlicher v. Steele</span> (615 F.Supp.2d 884, 2009), a federal district court reaffirmed that the physician certification is more than a signature. In the case, the court determined that the emergency physician who signed the certification did not adequately deliberate on the risks and benefits of the transfer of a woman in labor and the unborn child to another facility:</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style">There is no question that Dr. Steele signed the Consent for Transfer form … However, the evidence does suggest that Dr. Steele signed the form without actually deliberating and weighing the medical risks and benefits of the transfer, and he gave improper consideration to significant factors in the certification decision.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The court concluded that the physician justified the transfer with “nonexistent ‘benefits’ and ‘risks,’” ignored “the true foreseeable risks of the transfer” and “over-valued minimal or insignificant expected benefits” and “serious foreseeable risks.” The court’s analysis reinforces the importance not only of the documentation of the reasons, benefits and risks of  a transfer, but also the willingness of a court to review all available information to determine  the sufficiency of the physician certification.</p>

			<p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tips:</span> As noted in chapter 3, “Medical Screening Examinations,” the medical record should reflect the timely evaluation of a patient prior to a transfer.   A number of hospitals have been cited by CMS, and settled civil money penalty claims with the Office of Inspector General (OIG), for failing to assess a patient at the time of transfer, especially in cases when there was a delay between the order for transfer and the departure of the patient. In cases where the patient’s condition deteriorates during the transfer or upon arrival at the receiving facility, CMS and OIG will look closely at the patient’s ongoing monitoring and care provided immediately prior to the patient’s discharge to determine whether the patient’s condition was stabilized for the transfer. It is strongly recommended that hospitals document a patient’s vital signs and conduct a medical reassessment of the patient immediately preceding the departure of the patient from the hospital.</p>

				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"></a>Must a transfer be hospital to hospital?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">This question addresses two common inquiries — must transfers be hospital to hospital? Can a transfer be hospital to an emergency department?</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">With respect to the first question, the EMTALA statute and regulations, in prescribing the standards for an appropriate transfer, do not refer to the receiving facility as a “hospital.” Rather, the statute and regulations refer to the receiving facility more simply as a “medical facility.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The use of the term “facility” rather than “hospital” suggests that EMTALA permits a hospital  to transfer an EMTALA patient (i.e., an individual with an EMC) to a facility that is not a licensed hospital so long as the receiving facility has the capability and capacity to stabilize  the EMC. As pertinent to psychiatric emergency patients, the reference to a “medical facility” could be interpreted to permit hospitals to transfer an EMTALA patient to a psychiatric health facility (PHF) or a crisis stabilization unit (CSU) even if they are not considered to be “hospitals.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In November 2009, CMS Baltimore headquarters, in a letter to the author of this manual, indicated that there are circumstances in which a hospital could transfer an EMTALA patient with a psychiatric EMC to a CSU. The circumstances and conditions under which an EMTALA transfer could be made to a CSU are discussed in chapter 6.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The response to the second question, transfer from ED to ED, is within the discretion of the receiving hospital. While a transferring physician may request admission of a patient to a specific bed unit or department, the receiving hospital may route the patient through its ED or other bed unit or department based on clinical considerations. This is also addressed under <a href="">L.&#160;“Are transfers considered to be emergency department to emergency department?,” page&#160;7.10</a>.</p></li>

			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text"><a id="_idIndexMarker011"></a>Under a regulation adopted in 2009 by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Ca<span class="No-break">l/O</span>SHA), hospitals must follow specific standards for transferring patients who  have, or are suspected to have, an airborne infectious disease (AirID)<span class="CharOverride-3"><span id="footnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap5_rebuild.html#footnote-002">3</a></span></span>. The regulation defines “AirID” as either:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">An aerosol transmissible disease (ATD) transmitted through dissemination of airborne droplet nuclei, small particle aerosols, or dust particles containing the disease agent for which airborne infection isolation (AII) is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the California Department of Public Health (CDPH);<span class="CharOverride-3"><span id="footnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap5_rebuild.html#footnote-001">4</a></span></span> or</li>

			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">A hospital must admit a patient requiring AirID to an airborne infection isolation room in the hospital within 5 hours of identification, or transfer the patient to another facility within 5 hours unless the hospital documents each of the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-3">The hospital has contacted the local health officer;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">There is no room or area available within the jurisdiction of the local health officer;</li>

				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">All applicable measures recommended by the local health officer or the infection control physician (or other designated health care professional) have been implemented; and</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">All employees who enter the room or area housing the patient are provided with, and use, appropriate personal protective equipment and respiratory protection in accordance with the rules for respiratory protection.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">This documentation must be completed at the end of the five-hour period, and at least every 24 hours thereafter. However, if the treating physician determines that the transfer would be detrimental to a patient’s condition, the facility must:</p>

As discussed in <a href="EMTALA_Chap5_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor007">“Stabilized — The EMTALA Statute Versus the Interpretive Guidelines,” page 5.3</a>, it is advisable to avoid using the term “stable” to describe a patient’s condition.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Hospital staff should advise the receiving hospital as to why the patient is being transferred and the specific services required to stabilize the patient’s condition that the hospital cannot provide at the time of the transfer request.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Hospital staff should understand the clinical information that the receiving hospital needs to know in order to make an informed decision as to whether it has the capability and capacity to meet the patient’s needs.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">The <a id="_idIndexMarker012"></a>treating physician and hospital staff should call the receiving hospital, rather than an on-call physician at the receiving facility. If the receiving hospital has established a transfer center or a central number for processing requests for transfers, the sending hospital should call the transfer center or other centralized unit for handling transfers.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Do not call the receiving hospital emergency department and ask for the name and telephone number of an on-call physician before you have talked with staff  at the receiving hospital. Under EMTALA, transfers are hospital-to-hospital, and the receiving hospital should be able to assess its bed and service capacity and capability before contacting an on-call physician. Calling the on-call physician before talking with the hospital may delay the transfer. In addition, the accepting physician may not be aware of the receiving hospital’s capacity, which could result in a patient arriving for stabilizing services that are not available.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker013"></a>Have pertinent portions of the medical record available to provide orally,  electronically or in hard copy to the receiving hospital. If the receiving hospital requests portions of the medical record in order to evaluate whether it can meet the needs of a patient with an unstabilized EMC, give or send only clinical information (not financial information). If the time necessary to fax or transmit the record may jeopardize the condition of the patient, advise the receiving hospital that the delay    to send the records may result in further deterioration of the patient’s condition.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">If the patient’s EMC is not stabilized (i.e., an EMTALA transfer), do not discuss the patient’s financial status or insurance information with the receiving hospital or physician. Until the patient has been accepted, the receiving hospital and physician may not request financial status or insurance information for a patient with an EMC that is not stabilized.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">A transferring hospital may have a <a id="_idIndexMarker014"></a>transfer agreement with a receiving hospital. If so, make sure the staff is aware of the transfer procedures. A transfer agreement may expedite the transfer process and avoid communication problems between hospitals.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">If a receiving physician or hospital staff dispute the judgment of the treating  physician, CMS and the courts have reaffirmed that the judgment of the transferring physician will be granted greater weight in determining the patient’s status and clinical needs <span class="Italic">(see discussion of the St. Anthony’s decision in chapter 7, “Obligations of Receiving Hospitals”)</span>.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">If hospital staff believe that the receiving hospital or physician is not complying with the EMTALA obligations, or there is a dispute or a communication problem, request the opportunity to speak with the administrator-on-call at the receiving hospital to   try to resolve the problem.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">If hospital staff believe that the receiving hospital or physician refused a transfer for reasons that may violate EMTALA, report the circumstances to administration, risk management or the compliance officer (or other designated staff position) to review the case and decide whether follow-up action is appropriate.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Have a performance improvement process for evaluation of the transfer procedures, including compliance with the standards for an appropriate transfer, review of problematic cases, and the documentation of communications with receiving hospitals.</li></ol></li>

The use of personal vehicles to transfer a patient whose condition is not stabilized or resolved is not expressly prohibited under EMTALA; however, it is clearly disfavored and CMS will closely scrutinize  the reasons why personal transportation was used. The use of personal transportation for a patient whose EMC is not stabilized or resolved does not absolve the hospital from meeting the standards for an appropriate transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">If the emergency physician approves or recommends the use of a personal vehicle for the transfer, the physician should document his or her reasons in the medical record.

In general, EMTALA focuses on the capability and capacity of the hospital as   a whole, rather than the capability of the dedicated emergency department. For example, if a hospital provides obstetric services, the staff and resources of the obstetric service must be considered available to screen and treat a woman in labor who comes to the hospital.</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"></a>Capability to Provide Services<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">EMTALA compliance is more difficult if a hospital does not have an organized service or medical specialty to treat the needs of a particular emergency patient. CMS will determine on a case-by-case basis whether a hospital has the capability to provide a service even if the hospital is not licensed to offer that service. For example, in the preamble to the 1994 EMTALA regulations, CMS stated that a hospital that does not offer perinatal services may not transfer a woman having contractions if the hospital has the staff and facilities to perform an uncomplicated delivery. In a 2017 settlement, the OIG determined that a South Carolina hospital that maintained a “voluntary” psychiatric unit allegedly violated EMTALA by not providing psychiatric examination and treatment in the ED, and maintained “involuntary” psychiatric patients in the ED for “days and weeks” instead of admitting the patients to its voluntary psychiatric unit for stabilizing treatment. Further details of this case are discussed in chapter 6 of this manual.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"></a>Capacity to Provide Services<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The EMTALA regulations define <span class="Bold">“capacity”</span> as the ability to admit or treat patients (e.g., staff, beds and equipment) as well as the “hospital’s past practices of accommodating additional patients in excess of its occupancy limits.” As noted in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, if “a   hospital has customarily accommodated patients in excess of its occupancy limits … it has,   in fact, demonstrated the ability to provide services to patients in excess of its occupancy limits.” CMS will look at the hospital’s history of absorbing emergency patients by shifting patient room assignments or calling in additional staff. If a hospital has provided services to emergency patients in excess of its service capacity, CMS may allege an EMTALA violation if the hospital denies treatment to a similar patient with an EMC.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"></a>Capacity and Nurse Staffing Ratios<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idIndexMarker019"></a>The nurse staffing standards in California place a hospital in a Catch-22 situation when it has available beds but does not meet the staffing ratios at the time of an emergency admission. Does a hospital have “capacity” within the meaning of EMTALA to admit a critically ill  individual with an unresolved EMC if the admitting unit will not meet the staffing ratios; or, should (or must) the patient be transferred?</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In 2004, the Licensing and Certification Division of CDPH issued guidance in responding to “health care emergencies,” which it defined as temporary overcrowding and saturation due  to a rapid influx of patients. In a Jan. 9, 2004 memorandum to hospitals (AFL 04-01), CDPH stated the following:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-6">Hospitals are <span class="Bold">not required to seek prior approval from [CDPH], L&amp;C   to decrease staffing levels below required ratios during a healthcare emergency</span>. Hospitals are expected to respond immediately to emergency situations in the most effective manner to ensure the health and safety of their patients. They will not be found in violation of the nurse-to-patient ratio regulations during a healthcare emergency, provided they can demonstrate they took appropriate steps to try to maintain required staffing levels. (emphasis in original)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">CDPH has also noted that observation beds in a licensed emergency department are not counted in a hospital’s licensed bed capacity. According to CDPH, “hospitals are expected   to meet their obligations under state and federal laws to provide emergency services without regard to any requests to increase patient accommodations.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">CDPH has not issued additional advice on how it would interpret and enforce the staffing ratios with respect to an individual emergency admission or transfer when there is no saturation or overcrowding. In the absence of guidance, the hospital must decide whether to admit the patient (and possibly violate the nurse staffing ratios) or make an appropriate transfer of the patient to another hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">If the hospital admits the patient when it is out of compliance with staffing ratios, a surveyor may later cite the hospital under state law, which may subject the facility to fines or other sanctions under state and federal laws, as well as litigation by the patient if there is an adverse outcome. If the hospital transfers the patient, a surveyor may later review the admission patterns at the time of the transfer (were other patients admitted or transferred?) and the historical practices of the hospital in admitting or transferring patients in similar situations. The survey could result in an EMTALA violation, as well as potential litigation if there is an adverse outcome.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">CDPH has noted that hospital self-reporting for non-compliance with the staffing ratios is intended to apply only to “all occurrences that disrupt the operation of the facility,” including health care emergencies that result in a failure to meet the staffing ratios despite planning   for census fluctuations. Therefore, hospitals are not required to self-report all events that CDPH could cite as a violation. Self-reporting for an emergency admission (in the absence of a health care emergency) of a potential violation of the staffing ratios requires an evaluation    of the needs of the patient and other facts relating to the circumstances. Hospitals are encouraged to discuss this subject with their legal counsel.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"></a>Reserved Critical Care Beds<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Under CMS’s interpretation of “capacity,” a reserved intensive care unit (ICU) bed may be considered “available” for admission of a patient with an EMC, even if a nonemergency   surgery scheduled for another patient who will require an ICU bed must be delayed or cancelled. However, if an ICU bed is reserved for a patient who is already in surgery and there are no other open ICU beds, the hospital will be at its capacity.

The standards apply to a transfer of an ED patient   for economic reasons (i.e., inability to pay) or alignment of a patient with a contracting or in-network health plan facility. Some of the standards are similar to the EMTALA standards for an appropriate transfer of a patient with an unstabilized EMC; however, there are several additional standards including:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">A determination that the transfer will not create a “medical hazard” (this is defined in Health and Safety Code Section 1317.1(f), included as Appendix D);</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">An accepting physician has agreed to the transfer;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">The transfer documents include a “transfer summary” which is defined in the statute; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">The hospital has made and documented a reasonable attempt to notify a “preferred contact person” if known, or, if unknown, to ascertain a “preferred contact person”  or next of kin, before the transfer.</li></ol></li>

These laws have also been raised in other counties in California, but the enforcement actions in Los Angeles have received extensive publicity, including attention in a motion picture and by the national media.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-12">The media, the Los Angeles City Attorney, and various homeless advocates have focused considerable attention on the problem of an appropriate destination for discharged homeless patients. Concerns have been expressed that some hospitals may send discharged homeless patients to skid row areas of town so that those patients may stay in a shelter while further recuperating from their illness or injury. Some shelters have expressed the view that they are not staffed or equipped to handle a convalescing patient, especially a patient who requires follow-up care.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-12">This media and law enforcement attention has resulted in legislative and judicial efforts to change the procedures by which homeless patients are discharged from hospitals and to penalize hospitals for discharge decisions an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r for facilitating the transport of homeless patients to shelters or other destinations that cannot meet the needs of the patients.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"></a>Federal Laws on Emergency Patient Discharge<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">As discussed above, the EMTALA <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> require that emergency patients who are discharged must receive a plan for appropriate follow-up, including information necessary to prevent a relapse or worsening of their medical conditions.

This law requires hospitals to have a   written discharge planning policy and process, which includes “appropriate arrangements for posthospital care … are made prior to discharge for those patients who are likely to suffer adverse health consequences for posthospital care.” These arrangements include care at a skilled nursing or intermediate care facility, hospice or at home.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Section 1262.5 clearly applies whether a patient is or is not homeless, although unlike   Section 1262.4, it does not impose specific standards for homeless patients.<span class="CharOverride-3"><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap5_rebuild.html#footnote-000">5</a></span></span> CDPH has not issued a formal interpretation as to whether the discharge planning requirements of Section 1262.5 apply to emergency patients (as well as other outpatients). The author’s view is that,   in the absence of CDPH guidance or a judicial interpretation of the statute, Section 1262.5 applies only to the discharge of inpatients, and conversely, does not apply to emergency patients. This view is based on the wording of the statute and the legislative history, which indicate an intent to codify in state law the Medicare Condition of Participation for discharge planning (which, as noted above, do not apply to emergency patients).</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"></a>Litigation (City of Los Angeles)<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Beginning in December 2005, the Los Angeles City Attorney initiated enforcement efforts related to the transport of homeless patients to skid row. The initial effort involved a letter to several hospitals alerting them of possible legal action for their discharge practices involving homeless patients.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Since November 2006, the City Attorney has filed criminal and civil charges against several hospitals within and outside the City of Los Angeles for the practice of “homeless dumping.” The complaints generally allege that the hospitals discharged and transported to skid row homeless patients without a plan for post-hospital care or verifying that a place could    provide adequate shelter and recuperative care services. The complaints have included both criminal counts (such as false imprisonment and dependent adult endangerment), and civil complaints (such as unlawful and unfair business practices, including failure to follow state  law on discharge planning).</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In the complaints, the City Attorney has described “homeless dumping” as including the following elements:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Discharging homeless patients without proper clothing, sometimes no more than a hospital gown;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Discharging homeless patients on a gurney or wheelchair, with intravenous or other equipment attached to the patient;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Discharging homeless patients prematurely;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Arranging for homeless patients to be transported considerable distances, often up to 15 to 30 miles, notwithstanding the availability of a closer shelter; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Transporting homeless patients to skid row without first checking to determine the availability of shelter beds or services necessary for the patients.</li></ol></li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Since May 2007, the City Attorney has entered into several settlement agreements with hospitals that require the hospitals to develop a training program for hospital staff and a discharge protocol for all homeless patients (including emergency patients). The discharge protocol must be monitored by a third party who must approve the training program, review quarterly certifications of compliance and recommend contempt actions for violations of the settlement agreement. The settlement agreements also include funding of homeless services, fines and other costs.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Under the common form of the discharge protocol, the hospitals agree to the following practices for all homeless patients:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-3">Record homeless patients on a homeless patient log.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Provide appropriate clothing at the time of discharge.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Assess patient “cognitive intactness,” including living conditions and support systems; complexity of the discharge plan; orientation to person, time and place; ability to provide self-care; and access to medical care, food and shelter.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Perform a needs assessment, including food and shelter, treatment for substance abuse or domestic violence, vocational assistance, Medicaid enrollment and eligibility for other public services.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Establish discharge plans that meet patient medical and social needs, with appropriate referrals and help with eligibility for Kaiser’s Financial Assistance Program to obtain drugs or equipment.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">For a post-discharge referral to a shelter, the hospital must locate available options, assure that the patient meets the shelter’s criteria for acceptance and document the consent of the patient and shelter to the placement.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">For a patient seeking transport to a skid row shelter, the hospital administrator (or designee) must approve the discharge plan.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The hospitals also agreed to implement an in-service program for physician, clinical, social service, discharge planning and other staff involved in the care and discharge of homeless patients. The training program included the requirements of the discharge protocol; homelessness in Los Angeles County; problems faced by homeless patients; assessment of cognitive intactness; post-discharge issues; communication with homeless patients; location of shelters and services for the homeless; referral sources; the hazards of skid row; and the use of surrogate decision makers for homeless patients.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In 2008, the authority of the Los Angeles City Attorney was reinforced by the enactment of an ordinance by the Los Angeles City Council applying to the transportation by all health facilities of discharged patients. While the ordinance is directed to homeless patients, it applies to transporting all patients to a location other than their own residence or other another facility. Under the ordinance:</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style">A health facility may not transport or cause a patient to be transported to a location other than the patient’s residence without written consent, except when the patient is transferred to another health facility following bona fide procedures in accordance with another provision of law.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">For purposes of the ordinance:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-3">A <span class="Bold">“patient’s residence”</span> is defined as the home of the patient, the fixed and regular nighttime residence or domicile of the patient, or in the case of a patient who is reasonably perceived to be homeless, the location that the patient gives as his/her principal place of dwelling.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List"><span class="Bold">“Written consent”</span> is defined as knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily given written consent that is signed by the patient or his/her legal representative.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The ordinance does not apply to patients who are in the care and custody of state hospitals or correctional facilities or law enforcement.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Although the ordinance was adopted by the City of Los Angeles and clearly applies to  hospitals located within city limits, the City Attorney has interpreted the ordinance as applying to any hospital located outside of the city limits that transports a patient to any location (and especially skid row) within the City of Los Angeles in violation of the terms of the ordinance.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The City Attorney is continuing to initiate enforcement efforts in this area and to ensure that hospitals are proactively implementing guidelines regarding evaluation and discharge planning of homeless patients.</p>
