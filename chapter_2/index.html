Now, EMTALA applies only to an off-campus dedicated emergency department of a hospital. Therefore, if an individual presents to an off- campus department of a hospital that is not a dedicated emergency department,   the EMTALA obligations <span class="Italic">do not apply </span>to the patient visit.

If    a hospital has outpatient clinics that are listed on and operated under the hospital license (often referred to in California as 1206(d) clinics), the clinics are considered  to be part of the hospital and are subject to EMTALA if they are located on hospital property.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Indent-1 _idGenParaOverride-3">EMTALA does not apply to skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, or rural health clinics that are operated by hospitals, even if the facilities or clinics are listed on the hospital license. These services are billed to the Medicare program under separate provider numbers that are different from the provider number used to bill hospital services. In addition, EMTALA does not apply to hospital-owned suppliers of Medicare services that are billed separately from hospital services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Indent-1 _idGenParaOverride-3">In some instances, a hospital company may operate <a id="_idIndexMarker008"></a>clinics that are separately licensed or exempt from licensing. Examples of licensed clinics in California include “community clinics” and “surgical clinics,” both of which are subject to clinic licensing laws, and are listed on the hospital license or subject to hospital regulations. Examples of clinics that are exempt from licensing include primary care clinics operated by counties or other public agencies, clinics affiliated with teaching institutions, medical care foundation clinics and imaging centers. Licensed and exempt clinics are typically excluded from treatment as a provider-based department of the hospital, even if they are located on hospital property and owned or controlled by the company operating the hospital.</p></li></ol></li>

			<p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Practice Tip:</span> A hospital should review its license and billing practices to determine whether its clinics are part of the hospital for billing and cost reporting purposes. Even if the clinics are not subject to EMTALA, these departments and facilities may be subject to other state and federal rules, as well as accepted risk management practices, for responding to emergency situations.</p>

The term intended to distinguish between hospital departments that are held out as services for persons with urgent and emergency medical problems and other hospital departments   that primarily serve scheduled outpatients for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. As discussed below, the distinction is not always clear to providers and patients.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">A <span class="Bold">“dedicated emergency department”</span> is defined in the EMTALA regulations as a hospital department or facility that is located on the hospital campus or <a id="_idIndexMarker010"></a>off-campus, and meets any one of the following tests:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idIndexMarker011"></a><span class="Bold">License Test.</span> The department or facility is licensed by the state in which it is located as an emergency room or department;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idIndexMarker012"></a><span class="Bold">Holding Out Test.</span> The department or facility is held out to the public (by name, signs, advertising or other means) as a place that provides care for emergency medical conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment; or</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idIndexMarker013"></a><span class="Bold">One-Third Test.</span> The department or facility, based on a representative sample of patient visits within the preceding calendar year, provides at least one-third of all of its outpatient visits for the treatment of emergency medical conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment.</li></ol></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>How will CMS determine if a hospital department is a dedicated emergency department under the one-third test?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, CMS has provided guidance to the CMS regional offices and state<a id="_idIndexMarker014"></a> survey agencies to determine whether a hospital department meets the one-third test. The surveyor is directed to select a sample of patient visits to the department that occurred during the previous calendar year. The surveyor will review the facility log, appointment   roster and other appropriate information to identify the patients seen in the department or facility. The surveyor will then review 20 to 50 medical records of patients for diagnoses or presenting complaints; in consultation with the CMS regional office, the surveyor may expand the sample size in order to conduct an adequate investigation. The patient sample will be selected by the surveyor, not the hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The surveyor must then determine the number of patients who “had an emergency medical condition and received stabilizing treatment.” If one-third of the sample cases were for the treatment of emergency conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment, the department or facility will be considered to be a dedicated emergency department. The Investigative Procedures for EMTALA Surveyors portion of   the <span class="Italic">State Operations Manual</span> (Appendix K) notes that this procedure will apply to specialty hospitals (e.g., <a id="_idIndexMarker015"></a>psychiatric facilities), hospitals without a traditional emergency department, and <a id="_idIndexMarker016"></a>urgent care centers. In addition, the procedure may apply to both on-campus and off- campus departments and facilities of the hospital.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Are <a id="_idIndexMarker017"></a>labor and delivery and <a id="_idIndexMarker018"></a>psychiatric services considered dedicated emergency departments under EMTALA?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the preamble to the 2003 regulations, CMS reaffirmed that a dedicated emergency department includes not only what is generally considered to be a hospital’s “emergency room,” but also other departments of hospitals, such as labor and delivery and psychiatric units. As stated by CMS:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-8">Any area of the hospital that offers such medical services to treat individuals in labor to at least one-third of the ambulatory individuals who present to the area for care, even if the hospital’s practice is to admit such individuals as inpatients rather than listing them on an outpatient basis, <span class="CharOverride-6">would</span> be considered a dedicated emergency department. (Emphasis in original) [68 Fed. Reg. 53229]</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In recent years, CMS has been closely looking at freestanding acute psychiatric hospitals to determine whether they operate dedicated emergency departments for “walk-in” or other non-scheduled patients.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a>Are hospital urgent care centers and other ambulatory departments dedicated emergency departments under EMTALA?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idIndexMarker019"></a>In the preamble to the 2003 regulations, CMS rejected a request to exclude hospital urgent care centers from the EMTALA requirements, stating:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-8">We believe that it would be very difficult for any individual in need of emergency care to distinguish between a hospital department that provides care for an ‘urgent need’ and one that provides care for an ‘emergency medical condition’ need ... . As we have discussed above, if the department or facility is held out    to the public as a place that provides care for emergency medical conditions, it would meet the definition of dedicated emergency department. An urgent care center of this kind would fall under this criterion for dedicated emergency department status [68 Fed. Reg. 53431].</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">However, other guidance from CMS suggests that urgent care and other hospital departments that provide drop-in services for urgent and non-urgent conditions are not automatically considered to be dedicated emergency departments. For example, as noted above, the Investigative Procedures for EMTALA Surveyors portion of the <span class="Italic">State Operations Manual </span>states that the procedure to apply the “one-third test” may apply to an urgent care center or other hospital department only if more than one-third of the center’s or department’s patients presented for the treatment of “emergency” conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment. The guidance suggests that patients presenting only for treatment of “urgent” or “non-urgent” conditions on a drop-in basis will not result in the classification of the urgent care center or other department as a dedicated emergency department.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In addition, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> adopted to implement the Medicare Conditions of Participation for hospital outpatient services [42 C.F.R. Section 482.55] note that urgent care clinics may be organized as part of an <a id="_idIndexMarker020"></a>outpatient department or an emergency department. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> then state that an urgent care clinic will be evaluated for compliance with the integration standards for outpatient services (rather than the integration standards for emergency departments) if three conditions are met:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The urgent care clinic is held out to the public as providing only urgent care services and possibly other services;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The hospital clearly advises the public that the urgent care clinic is not an emergency department; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The urgent care clinic does not meet the definition of a dedicated emergency department under EMTALA.</li></ol></li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In some states, urgent care centers and similar departments are licensed as outpatient services. For example, in California, an outpatient service is defined as “the rendering of nonemergency health care” to patients [Title 22, California Code of Regulations, Section 70525].</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As indicated in this discussion, there is some confusion as to whether urgent care centers and similar drop-in hospital departments (e.g., an <a id="_idIndexMarker021"></a>occupational medicine clinic) that are not licensed or operated as typical emergency departments are dedicated emergency departments within the meaning of EMTALA. How an urgent care center is held out to the public may be a critical factor in whether an urgent care center is treated as a dedicated emergency department or excepted from EMTALA. This is illustrated in a 2016 court decision that focused on the signage for a hospital-operated urgent care center. The hospital argued that its website clearly stated that its urgent care center was for non-emergency  needs. However, the court noted that the on-site signage for the urgent care center did not distinguish between urgent care and emergent care; therefore, a person driving by the urgent care center (in this instance, with chest pains) would be unlikely to check the website before entering the urgent care center. As a result, the court declined to rule in favor of the hospital based on the patient’s perception from the signage that the clinic would be an appropriate place to receive emergency care. This case, <span class="Italic">Friedrich et at. v. South County Hospital Healthcare System, et al.</span>, is discussed in chapter 14.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> The broad definition of dedicated emergency department requires  a hospital to evaluate all of its ambulatory care departments (on- and off-campus) to identify the services that meet the definition of a dedicated emergency department. In addition to reviewing the volume of drop-in patients, the hospital should also review its website, signage, advertising, other promotional materials, and information disseminated to the public regarding the availability of drop-in services.</p>

				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a>How does EMTALA apply to a hospital that does not have a dedicated emergency department?</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The first subsection of the EMTALA statute triggers the medical screening obligation for an individual who comes to a “hospital that has an emergency department.” However, the second subsection of the EMTALA statute triggers the obligations for further examination and stabilizing treatment and transfers for an individual “who comes to a hospital.”</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The EMTALA regulations define a <span class="Bold">“hospital with an emergency department”</span> as “a hospital with a dedicated emergency department.” The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> indicate that hospitals that do not provide emergency services must meet the standards of the Medicare Conditions of Participation [42 C.F.R. Section 482.12(f)(2); <span class="Italic">see Appendix E</span>], which require all participating hospitals to have written <a id="_idIndexMarker022"></a>policies and procedures for the appraisal of emergencies, initial treatment within the capability and capacity of the hospital, and appropriate referral of emergency patients to hospitals that are capable of providing the necessary emergency services. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> for Section 482.12(f) require that staff at any hospital location know how to respond to individuals (patients, staff, visitors and others) seeking or in need of medical and psychiatric emergency services.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> state that a hospital with a dedicated emergency department  must comply with the medical screening, stabilizing treatment, transfer and other obligations of EMTALA. However, all hospitals participating in the Medicare program, regardless of maintaining a dedicated emergency department, are subject to the Medicare receiving hospital obligation, and must accept an appropriate transfer of an individual with an emergency medical condition who requires specialized capabilities not available at the transferring hospital.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Hospitals (including critical access hospitals) that do not have a physician present in the hospital on a full-time basis must provide a written <a id="_idIndexMarker023"></a>notice to all patients at the beginning of their hospital stay or outpatient visit stating that a physician is not present in the hospital 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The notice must explain how the hospital will meet the medical needs of a patient who develops an emergency medical condition during the course of an inpatient stay or outpatient encounter at a time when no physician is present in the hospital. The law states that an inpatient stay or outpatient encounter is considered to begin with    the provision of a package of information regarding scheduled preadmission testing and registration for a planned hospital admission for inpatient care or outpatient service. Prior to admitting the patient or providing an outpatient service, the hospital must receive a signed acknowledgment from the patient indicating the patient’s understanding that a physician may not be present in the hospital at all times. The notice is a condition of the Medicare provider agreement, a violation of which may result in termination of the agreement.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If a hospital does not have a dedicated emergency department, it is recommended that the hospital consult with its legal counsel to determine:</p>

				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"></a>What is <a id="_idIndexMarker024"></a>“Hospital Property” Under EMTALA?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">As discussed above, the EMTALA obligations are triggered not only when an individual presents to a dedicated emergency department seeking or in need of examination or treatment for a medical condition, but also when an individual presents on “hospital property” (other than a dedicated emergency department) seeking or in need of examination or treatment for a potential emergency medical condition. Since 1994, CMS has gradually expanded the scope of “hospital property.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">In 2003, CMS attempted to clarify the extent of “hospital property” to give providers greater certainty as to the areas and structures on and surrounding the hospital campus that are considered to be hospital property. For the purpose of determining when the EMTALA obligations are triggered for an individual who presents on the hospital campus, <span class="Bold">“hospital property”</span> is defined as the main hospital buildings and the areas within 250 yards of the main hospital buildings (unless the hospital has obtained approval from CMS for an alternative description of the hospital property). Although the regulations do not define what are the “main hospital buildings,” a general rule of thumb is to measure the <a id="_idIndexMarker025"></a>250 yards from the perimeter of the main building(s) in which inpatient services are provided by the hospital.</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"></a>Main Hospital Facility<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">EMTALA applies to any person who enters the main inpatient building(s) of a hospital seeking or in need of services for what may be an emergency medical condition, even if the patient does not present to a dedicated emergency department. Therefore, all areas of the main inpatient building(s) are potential points of entry for triggering the EMTALA obligations.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"></a>Freestanding On-Campus Buildings and Services<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">EMTALA applies to any department or service operated by a hospital under its Medicare provider number that is located within 250 yards of the perimeter of the main hospital building(s) (although the CMS regional office may, on a case-by-case basis, include other structure<span class="No-break">s/a</span>reas in the hospital campus). As discussed in the next question (“What areas are excluded from hospital property?”), there are some services and buildings on hospital property that may not be subject to EMTALA.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"></a>Other Areas on the Hospital Property</li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The term “hospital property” includes hospital structures and areas, such as parking lots, driveways and sidewalks that are within 250 yards of the perimeter of the main hospital building(s). The applicability of EMTALA to hospital parking lots and access ways was emphasized by a nationally announced enforcement action against a hospital for failing to respond to a patient in crisis on the sidewalk in front of the hospital.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> Hospitals should adopt policies and procedures for responding   to emergencies occurring on hospital property outside of the main hospital building. The policies should address who should respond to on-campus emergencies, procedures for moving patients to the emergency department or calling for emergency transport, documentation of the occurrence and a quality improvement review of the hospital’s handling of the emergency situation. The policies should be reinforced by in-service training programs, including security personnel who are often the first responders to the scene of an emergency on the hospital campus.</p>

If the presenting medical condition is not of an emergent nature, the hospital is still required to perform a medical screening examination   that would be appropriate for any individual presenting in similar circumstances to confirm  that the individual does not have an emergency medical condition. The scope of the medical screening for these types of patients is described in chapter 3.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">However, CMS has issued guidance that certain patients presenting to a dedicated emergency department for certain services may not trigger the EMTALA obligations.

Hospitals should consult with their legal counsel regarding how the appointment programs implicate the EMTALA obligations. In the absence of guidance from CMS regarding the effect of appointment reservation programs in the emergency department, the best practice for hospitals is to comply with the EMTALA requirements for patients who sign up for an appointment at a dedicated emergency department.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"></a>Presentation to an On-Campus Hospital Department that is Not a Dedicated Emergency Department</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">If an individual has a scheduled appointment to receive care from a hospital service that is not a dedicated emergency department (e.g., an imaging procedure, laboratory test, physical therapy session or cardiac rehabilitation program), EMTALA does not apply to the patient once he or she has begun an “encounter” with a health care professional in the department. For purposes of EMTALA, an “encounter” is a “direct personal contact” between  a patient and a physician or other caregiver who may order or furnish hospital diagnostic or treatment services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In addition, EMTALA does not apply if the patient, during the course of his or her outpatient encounter, requests or is in obvious need of emergency services (e.g.,, the patient has a cardiac arrest while on the treadmill), even if the patient is moved to a dedicated emergency department for further examination and stabilizing treatment. Instead, CMS will apply the Medicare Conditions of Participation to the examination and treatment rendered to the outpatient if the need for emergency care arises during his or her encounter.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">As an example, CMS has described the hypothetical case of an outpatient who comes  to the physical therapy department for a scheduled appointment. During the encounter, the patient experiences chest pains and lightheadedness, and is taken to the dedicated emergency department for follow-up examination and treatment. Although personnel in the dedicated emergency department may (and should) provide emergency services to the patient in the same manner as any other patient presenting to the department with similar signs and symptoms, the EMTALA obligations will not apply to the patient since the need for emergency care arose during the outpatient encounter in the physical therapy department. Instead, the response by the hospital is subject to the standards of the Medicare Conditions of Participation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">Although not expressly stated in the regulations, it appears that EMTALA applies to an outpatient if he or she requests or is in need of emergency services prior to the encounter or after the encounter is completed (e.g.,, the patient faints or has a medical crisis while leaving the hospital or in the parking lot).</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-5"><span class="Reference-mark CharOverride-3">F</span>&#9;References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-3">42 C.F.R.

In some cases, the referring physician has seen the patient immediately preceding the patient’s arrival at the hospital; in other cases, the physician has not seen the patient prior to his or her arrival at the hospital, but may have provided an ongoing course of treatment to the patient. Occasionally, a patient is directed to meet his or her primary care physician in the emergency department for examination or treatment.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the preamble to the 2003 regulations, CMS reaffirmed that EMTALA applies to any individual who presents to a dedicated emergency department seeking examination or treatment for any medical condition. As noted by CMS, pharmaceutical services in a dedicated emergency department may be for medical conditions, and are therefore subject to EMTALA [68 Fed. Reg. 53235]. EMTALA will apply if an individual presents for injections  or other treatment for a medical condition, even if the individual arrives with orders from an attending staff member. Therefore, hospitals should record these patients in the central log, open a medical record and provide a medical screening examination.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">This position expressed by CMS in the preamble is reinforced in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>. CMS states that if a patient presents to a dedicated emergency department for pharmaceutical services for a medical condition, the hospital “generally” has an EMTALA obligation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The CMS position, however, implies that not all requests by patients presenting to a dedicated emergency department for pharmaceutical services implicate EMTALA, and therefore require a medical screening examination. However, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> do not provide sufficient guidance to determine the categories of medication requests that do not trigger the EMTALA obligations. Hospitals and their medical staffs should also consider regulatory and risk management issues when deciding whether to administer medication in the absence of a medical screening examination for patients presenting to an emergency department for pharmaceutical services. Therefore, the best practice is for hospitals to provide a medical screening examination, and other EMTALA-required services, to patients presenting for pharmaceutical services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">It is noted that EMTALA does not require a hospital to provide medication to patients who,  as a result of the medical screening examination, are determined not to have an emergency medical condition. As stated by CMS, EMTALA does not require a hospital to provide medication to a non-emergent patient “because the individual is unable to pay or does not wish to purchase the medication from a retail pharmacy or did not plan appropriately to secure prescription refills.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">If an individual comes to a hospital department that is not a dedicated emergency department with a prescription or seeking pharmaceutical services, the EMTALA obligations will not apply to the request unless the individual requests or is in obvious need of examination or treatment for what may be an emergency medical condition. In these cases, hospitals should follow their standard policies and procedures for pharmacy services requested by nonemergency patients.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">Although the EMTALA obligations apply to all individuals who present to a dedicated emergency department, hospitals may tailor their medical screenings for patients who   present at a dedicated emergency department for nonemergency services.

However, CMS has indicated that EMTALA does not apply to individuals who present to a dedicated emergency department and request services that are not an examination or treatment for a medical condition. Some examples of these situations include the following.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker030"></a>Preventive Care Services</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the preamble to the 2003 EMTALA regulations, CMS, without explanation, listed “preventive health services” as one example of a request for services that does not trigger the requirement for a medical screening examination [68 Fed. Reg. 53235]. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> provide three examples of “preventive care services” — immunizations, allergy shots and flu shots.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">However, if a person presenting for these types of preventive care services requests or is in need of an examination for a medical condition, EMTALA may apply and the patient should be treated in the same manner as other patients presenting for emergency services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker031"></a>Blood Pressure Checks</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the past, CMS Region IX has suggested that EMTALA probably does not apply to persons presenting to an emergency department for routine blood pressure checks offered as a community service to all area residents.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> qualify this past advice. As explained by CMS, a hospital may  have a policy or protocol (or, as applicable, a standardized procedure) permitting a qualified professional in a dedicated emergency department to conduct medical screenings within his or her scope of practice. As an example, CMS cites a request for a blood pressure check. If a person presenting for a routine blood pressure check, upon screening, has a reading within normal limits and there are no other signs or symptoms indicating the presence of an emergency medical condition, the hospital is not required under EMTALA to provide services beyond what was needed to determine the absence of an emergency condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">However, if a person presenting for a routine blood pressure check also requests or is in need of an examination for a medical condition, EMTALA may apply and the patient should be treated in the same manner as other patients presenting for emergency services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"></a>Blood Alcohol Tests and Sexual Assault Cases</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the preamble to the 2003 regulations, CMS stated that requests by law enforcement personnel for <a id="_idIndexMarker032"></a>medical clearance of incarcerated patients, or blood alcohol or other tests to   be used as evidence in criminal proceedings, would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the hospital is required to provide a medical screening and other required EMTALA services [68 Fed. Reg. 53235].</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> provide additional direction for hospitals in law enforcement   cases. In general, the “gathering of evidence for criminal law cases (e.g., sexual assault,   blood alcohol test)” does not trigger the requirements for a medical screening examination or other EMTALA required services. However, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> qualify this exemption from EMTALA:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-8">If an individual is brought to the ED and law enforcement personnel request  that emergency department personnel draw blood for a BAT only and [do] not request examination or treatment for a medical condition, such as intoxication, and a <a id="_idIndexMarker033"></a>prudent layperson would not believe that the individual needed such examination or treatment, then the EMTALA’s screening requirement is not applicable to this situation because the request made on behalf of the individual was for evidence. However, if for example, the individual in police custody was involved in a motor vehicle accident or may have sustained   injury to him or herself and presents to the ED, a MSE would be warranted to determine if an EMC exists.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> further clarify that requests for pre-jail clearance trigger the EMTALA obligations, and that hospitals should provide a medical screening examination to determine whether the individual has an emergency medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">With respect to rape and sexual assault cases, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> state that the same principle described above for blood alcohol testing also applies to individuals presenting to a dedicated emergency department in connection with rape or sexual assault.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In summary, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> direct surveyors to review each case on its own    merits to determine whether EMTALA applies to law enforcement requests. In conducting   staff in-service training, hospitals should consider that even if law enforcement personnel do not request medical care for a patient in custody, the EMTALA obligations will be triggered if a prudent layperson would believe that the patient’s behavior or appearance indicates the need to provide examination or treatment for a medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">For further guidance on medical procedures requested by law enforcement, California hospitals should review chapter 6 of CHA’s <span class="Italic">Consent Manual</span>.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"></a>Other Nonemergency Tests</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, CMS states that the presentation by an individual to a  dedicated emergency department for the collection of evidence (e.g., a lab test) does not trigger the EMTALA obligations so long as the request does not include analysis of the lab results or an examination or treatment of the individual.

In  the <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> case, a patient with “severe respiratory distress” was in a nonhospital-owned ambulance on the way to a hospital when the ambulance personnel contacted the hospital. The emergency physician asked the name of the patient’s physician and told the ambulance personnel that he believed that “it would be okay” to redirect the ambulance to the patient’s aligned facility (in this case, an Army medical center). The total ambulance time with change in direction was 16 minutes. As discussed in chapter 14, “Private Actions to Enforce EMTALA,” the court interpreted the phrase “comes to the emergency department” as including an individual who is en route to the hospital. Since the hospital was not on diversion, the court ruled that the hospital could not redirect the ambulance.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">CMS has informally indicated that it does not consider the <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> decision to be consistent with the EMTALA regulations or binding on EMTALA enforcement.

			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">For many years, CMS Region IX has stated that EMTALA does not apply to an individual in an ambulance that comes onto hospital property to access the hospital’s helipad as a part of a prearranged transfer between two other hospitals or to a regional trauma facility. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> address the use of hospital helipads under EMTALA.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">CMS states that the use of a hospital helipad by local ambulance services or other hospitals to transport a patient to a tertiary (or trauma) hospital does not trigger an EMTALA obligation for the hospital that owns the helipad if two conditions are met:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The helipad is being used for the purpose of transit; and</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The sending hospital has conducted a medical screening of the patient prior to transporting the patient to the helipad.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">However, the Guidelines state that if the ambulance crew or the patient (while on-site at the hospital with the helipad) requests the medical assistance of the hospital (e.g.,, the patient’s condition has deteriorated or the patient requires intubation), the hospital must provide emergency services consistent with its EMTALA obligations. Some EMS agencies have adopted policies that include standards for a non-destination hospital to which an ambulance may divert during the course of an arranged transport to a trauma center or  other facility. These policies do not override the EMTALA obligations. If the ambulance crew or the patient requests examination or treatment at a non-destination hospital, the EMTALA obligations may apply, and the hospital must enter the patient in the central log, open a patient record, conduct a medical screening, provide treatment within its capability and reconfirm the transfer to the destination facility. In some instances, this may be a very short visit. However, there is risk of an EMTALA violation if the non-destination hospital provides a quick evaluation or treatment of the patient without following the EMTALA requirements.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text"><span class="All-Caps-Bold">Note:</span> CMS has issued two memoranda on the use of emergency transport personnel  on hospital property to hold and monitor an emergency patient pending the availability of services in the emergency department. The memoranda are discussed in chapter 3 under the question <a href="">J.&#160;“Can emergency departments request emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics to stay with a patient transported to the hospital emergency department when the department is saturated?,” page&#160;3.9</a>.</p>

For several years, there has been a split in opinion between the federal circuit  courts of appeal as to whether EMTALA applies to inpatients, including the transfer and discharge of inpatients in an unstabilized condition. Prior to the 2003 EMTALA regulations,   the 1st and 6th Circuit Courts of Appeal applied EMTALA to inpatient discharges and  transfers. In contrast, the 4th and 9th Circuit Courts of Appeal declined to extend EMTALA to the treatment, transfer or discharge of inpatients. These cases are discussed in chapter 14, “Private Actions to Enforce EMTALA.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In <span class="Italic">Roberts v. Galen of Virginia, Inc.</span>, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals applied EMTALA to the transfer of an inpatient in an allegedly unstabilized condition to a long-term care facility after   a two-month hospital stay. During oral argument on an appeal of the Court’s decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Solicitor General (on behalf of the federal government) advised    the Court that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services would adopt regulations clarifying whether EMTALA applied to inpatients.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In 2003, CMS addressed the “inpatient” issue by providing that the EMTALA obligations    are terminated when an individual is admitted in good faith for inpatient care in order to stabilize an emergency medical condition. The regulations adopt the definition of “inpatient” in the Medicare Hospital Manual: “a person who has been admitted to a hospital for bed occupancy for purposes of receiving inpatient hospital services.” However, CMS warned  that EMTALA will apply if a hospital admits an emergency patient in bad faith (i.e., to avoid EMTALA requirements), and then inappropriately transfers or discharges the individual without meeting the stabilization requirement.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The EMTALA regulations apply to the interpretation and enforcement of EMTALA by CMS. They are not binding on the courts. In a 2009 decision, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals observed that the regulation excluding inpatients from EMTALA “is contrary to the plain language” of the EMTALA statute. In the case, the inpatient stay occurred prior to the 2003 change in the regulations, so the decision did not strike down the regulation. In 2012, a district court in Texas reached a similar conclusion. The decisions, <span class="Italic">Moses v. Providence Hospital and Medical Ctrs.</span> and <span class="Italic">Liles v. TH Healthcare, LTD, et al.</span>, are discussed in chapter 14.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In 2008, CMS amended the EMTALA regulations to clarify that the obligation to accept the transfer of an emergency patient does not apply to the transfer of an inpatient at another hospital. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> clarify that emergency patients who are placed in <a id="_idIndexMarker039"></a>observation status are not inpatients, even if they occupy a bed overnight in the observation unit. Therefore, the receiving hospital obligation applies to the transfer of an emergency patient in observation status.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In 2012, CMS confirmed, in commentary, that it was maintaining its current policy that EMTALA obligations end when an individual is admitted in good faith for inpatient care in order to stabilize an emergency medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">Inpatients continue to be subject to the standards and protections of the Medicare Conditions of Participation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-5"><span class="Reference-mark CharOverride-3">F</span>&#9;References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-3">42 C.F.R.

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Under the 2003 regulations, EMTALA does not apply to individuals who are admitted as hospital inpatients, regardless of the location of the inpatient within the hospital building. In the preamble to the 2003 regulations, CMS stated that EMTALA would not apply to an inpatient who is in a dedicated emergency department waiting for an inpatient bed:</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style">… individuals who are “boarded” and admitted in the dedicated emergency department would be determined to be inpatients for purposes of EMTALA if, generally, they have been admitted by the hospital with the expectation that they will remain at least overnight and occupy beds in the hospital [68 Fed.

The statute was amended in 1988, 1989, 2003 and 2011. EMTALA applies to anyone who presents for emergency services to a hospital that participates in the Medicare program (including psychiatric hospitals). The EMTALA statute is included as Appendix A. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">EMTALA was enacted in response to studies that found that indigent emergency patients had been turned away from hospitals for necessary services or transferred (i.e., “dumped”) to public and charity hospitals in an unstabilized condition. Although EMTALA was passed to mandate access to emergency services by the indigent, Congress applied the EMTALA requirements to all patients regardless of financial or insurance status. In general, both the federal regulatory agencies and the courts have defined the primary objectives of EMTALA as twofold: to enhance access by all persons to emergency services and to prohibit <a id="_idIndexMarker000"></a>discrimination in the provision of emergency services to persons presenting with the same or similar types of conditions. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"></a>The EMTALA Regulations <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The initial EMTALA regulations were published in draft form in 1988, and issued as interim final regulations on June 22, 1994. On April 7, 2000, the regulations were amended to apply the EMTALA obligations to off-campus hospital services. In September 2003, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (<a id="_idIndexMarker001"></a>CMS) published further changes to the EMTALA regulations, repealing part of the 2000 regulations and clarifying the application of EMTALA to emergency patients, outpatients and inpatients. Since 2004, CMS has amended the EMTALA regulations in piecemeal fashion in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. The current regulations are included as Appendix B. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>The EMTALA <span class="CharOverride-1">Interpretive Guidelines</span> <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker002"></a>CMS has adopted <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> as part of the <span class="Italic">Medicare State Operations Manual</span> to provide guidance for federal and state surveyors in their enforcement of EMTALA. Although the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> are not regulations, they are considered the official interpretation of EMTALA by CMS and are used by California Department of Public Health (CDPH) surveyors and CMS regional offices in enforcement of the EMTALA obligations. The most recent update to the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> was July 16, 2010; the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> are included as Appendix C. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="All-Caps-Bold">Note:</span> The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> are organized by “<a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a>tag numbers,” each of which corresponds to a CMS regulation that establishes the rules for EMTALA. The tag numbers beginning with the letter “A” are applicable to hospitals and the tag numbers beginning with the letter “C” are applicable to <a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a>critical access hospitals. Each tag number has four digits, with the number “2” at the beginning of each tag number. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker005"></a>Special Advisory Bulletins and Other Guidance <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">In November 1999, CMS and the <a id="_idIndexMarker006"></a>Office of Inspector General (OIG) released a final Special Advisory Bulletin on EMTALA and managed care. The Bulletin discusses the rules on seeking health plan authorization prior to the medical screening examination (which were added to the EMTALA regulations in 2003), dual staffing of emergency departments and recommended patient registration practices to minimize violations of EMTALA. The Bulletin is discussed in chapter 4, “Financial Considerations — EMTALA and Managed Care,” and is included as Appendix H. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">From time to time, CMS issues Program Memoranda on various subjects relating to EMTALA obligations. Most of these memoranda have been incorporated into the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span><span class="Italic"> </span>(Appendix C). This manual includes the latest CMS guidance on critical access hospital on-call compliance with EMTALA (Appendix Y), conflicting payor requirements (Appendix X), and Ebola implications for EMTALA (Appendix AA).

As described in chapter 13, “Regulatory Enforcement of EMTALA,” the federal agencies charged with ensuring EMTALA compliance are CMS and the OIG. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">CMS has the authority to conduct complaint and enforcement surveys for EMTALA compliance, and to terminate a hospital’s Medicare provider agreement upon confirming one or more violations of EMTALA. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Under the EMTALA statute (Appendix A), the OIG has the authority to impose civil money penalties up to $50,000 against hospitals and physicians ($25,000 for hospitals with less than 100 beds), an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r to exclude a hospital or physician from the Medicare and Medicaid programs for violations of EMTALA that are “gross and flagrant or repeated.” In December 2016, the OIG issued final regulations updating the amount of civil money penalties, including EMTALA fines. Effective in 2017, the OIG may now impose civil penalties up to $104,826 against hospitals and physicians ($52,414 for hospitals with less than 100 beds) for an EMTALA violation. The maximum amount of the fines is subject to annual adjustment for inflation. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The regional <a id="_idIndexMarker007"></a>quality improvement organization (QIO) is responsible for assisting CMS and OIG review patient stabilization and other medical matters pertaining to the delivery of emergency care and services. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">For hospitals that have community service obligations under the <a id="_idIndexMarker008"></a>Hill-Burton Act, the <a id="_idIndexMarker009"></a>Office for Civil Rights (OCR) will follow up on violations of EMTALA confirmed by CMS with a request for copies of EMTALA compliance, transfer, admission and other hospital policies.  </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>EMTALA Committees and Reports <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Since 2001, there have been a number of committees and governmental agencies that have issued reports on EMTALA, including reports regarding compliance by hospitals and physicians with EMTALA standards, the enforcement process and the overall effect of the law. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker010"></a>Office of Inspector General </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In January 2001, the OIG released two reports on EMTALA: “Survey of Hospital Emergency Departments” and “The Enforcement Process.” </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIG’s “Survey of Hospital Emergency Departments” made the following findings: </p><ol>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Emergency department personnel are familiar with the EMTALA requirements, but many are unaware of recent policy changes. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Training increases EMTALA familiarity for all staff; unfortunately, on-call specialists and staff in high-volume emergency departments are less likely to receive training. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Hospital staff report that hospitals generally comply with EMTALA, but some express concerns about compliance. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Hospital staff believe that some aspects of EMTALA are unclear or questionable. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Hospital staff believe that while EMTALA may help protect patients, it also may contribute to a hospital’s administrative and financial problems. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Investigations, many of which do not confirm violations, often prompt changes in forms and procedures. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Managed care creates special problems for hospitals in complying with EMTALA. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Hospitals have difficulty staffing on-call panels for some specialists. </li>
					</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIG report made three conclusions: </p><ol>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">CMS should use a variety of methods to communicate important policy changes, including e-mail and the Internet. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">CMS should support legislation that compels managed care plans to reimburse hospitals for EMTALA-related services, including screening exams that do not reveal the presence of an emergency medical condition. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Uncompensated care and on-call panels are very complex problems that may require action at the federal, state and local levels, as well as by private entities. </li>
					</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIG reported that CMS concurred with its recommendations. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In “The Enforcement Process” report, the OIG issued the following findings on the EMTALA enforcement process: </p><ol>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">The EMTALA enforcement process is compromised by long delays and inadequate feedback. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The number of EMTALA investigations and their ultimate disposition vary widely by CMS region and year. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Poor tracking of EMTALA cases impede oversight. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Peer review is not always obtained before CMS considers terminating a hospital for medical reasons. </li>
					</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIG report recommended that CMS increase its oversight of the regional offices, improve collection and access to EMTALA data, ensure that peer review occurs for cases involving medical judgment, and establish an EMTALA technical advisory group. The OIG reported that CMS concurred with its recommendations. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker011"></a>General Accountability Office </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In June 2001, the U.S. General Accountability Office (GAO) released its own report entitled “EMTALA Implementation and Enforcement Issues.” Among other findings, the GAO reported that providers generally support the goals of EMTALA, but are uncertain about the extent of their obligations and have concerns about its effects on emergency care. In Table 1 of the report, the GAO listed seven issues identified as provider uncertainties: </p><ol>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">Scope of the medical screening exam </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Definition of patient stability for transfer </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Obligations for post-hospital care </li>

						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Compliance with local emergency medical systems for routing of ambulances </li>
					</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The comments by CMS on those issues are addressed in various sections of this manual. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Regarding the enforcement of EMTALA, the GAO reported that most EMTALA violations involve failure to screen, stabilize or transfer appropriately. They noted that although hospitals have concerns about CMS enforcement, CMS usually accepts corrective action plans and rarely terminates hospitals from the Medicare program. Finally, the GAO found that the OIG focuses on future compliance in assessing fines for EMTALA violations, and generally does not pursue a physician in the absence of clearly culpable behavior. The GAO endorsed many of the OIG recommendations in the two earlier reports discussed above. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In April 2009, the GAO issued a report entitled “Hospital Emergency Departments — Crowding Continues to Occur, and Some Patients Wait Longer than Recommended Time Frames.” The report looked at indicators of emergency department crowding, including ambulance diversion, wait times and patient boarding. The report determined that the primary factor for emergency department crowding is the lack of inpatient beds, with the following secondary factors: lack of access to primary care, a shortage of available on-call specialists and difficulties with transferring or discharging psychiatric patients. The report, “GAO-09-347,” can be accessed on the GAO website at <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09347.pdf" target="_system">www.gao.go<span class="No-break">v/n</span>ew.item<span class="No-break">s/</span><span class="No-break">d</span>09347.pdf</a>. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a>EMTALA <a id="_idIndexMarker013"></a>Technical Advisory Group </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In the 2003 Medicare reform legislation, Congress directed the Secretary of HHS to establish a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to solicit advice concerning the EMTALA regulations and enforcement. The Secretary signed the charter establishing the TAG on May 11, 2004; the TAG had a term of 30 months. The TAG was composed of 19 members, including four hospital representatives and seven physicians. The final meeting of the TAG was Sept. 17-18, 2007. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The TAG had the following responsibilities: </p><ol>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">Review the EMTALA regulations; </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Provide advice and recommendations to the Secretary concerning the regulations and their application to hospitals and physicians; </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Solicit comments and recommendations from providers and the public regarding the implementation of the regulations; and </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Disseminate information on the EMTALA regulations to providers and the public. </li>
					</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">During its tenure, the TAG issued seven reports and made several recommendations to CMS, some of which resulted in changes to the regulations and others in updated guidance issued in Program Memoranda. At its final meeting, the TAG adopted a series of recommendations related to accepting hospital obligations, clarification of conditions that constitute an “emergency medical condition,” clarification of the term “stabilization” (including a proposed concept of “temporary stabilization”), and procedures and criteria for transferring patients with stabilized conditions to physician offices for follow-up evaluation and care. It is uncertain whether these recommendations will be accepted by CMS, and if so, whether there will be any changes. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Further information on the TAG, including meeting agendas and reports, is available on the CMS website at <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/EMTALA/03_emtalatag.asp" target="_system">www.cms.hhs.go<span class="No-break">v/E</span>MTAL<span class="No-break">A/0</span>3_emtalatag.asp</a>. </p></li></ol></li>
					<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"></a>EMTALA Compliance <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Hospitals should adopt a hospital-wide policy that commits the facility to comply with EMTALA, as well as quality improvement, risk management and corporate compliance programs to monitor adherence with EMTALA standards. A model policy is included as Appendix O. Other recommended EMTALA policies are discussed throughout this manual and are listed in Appendix N. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker014"></a>State Laws <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The EMTALA statute expressly provides that the federal obligations do not preempt state and local emergency laws unless they conflict with the EMTALA obligations. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Some states have adopted emergency services statutes or regulations. Readers of this manual should consult with their legal counsel as to the effect of these laws. (Relevant California laws are discussed in this manual.) </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">In 1987, the California Legislature amended the hospital licensing laws to enact state patient anti-dumping laws. The California emergency medical service requirements are similar to EMTALA requirements, with some exceptions that are discussed in this manual. The following are some examples: </p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">California law applies to hospitals that are licensed to provide emergency services; EMTALA applies to all hospitals that provide emergency services, even if they do not have licensed emergency departments. </li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">California law expressly prohibits <a id="_idIndexMarker015"></a>discrimination in the provision of emergency services by hospitals and physicians. </li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">EMTALA focuses on whether a patient with an emergency condition is “stabilized” for transfer or discharge; California law primarily focuses on transfers that are made for nonmedical reasons (e.g., insurance or financial reasons), which apply to patients with emergency conditions that are considered to be stabilized. California law does not apply to a transfer that is made for medical reasons (although other state requirements pertaining to the transfer of patients may apply). </li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The California licensing laws on “emergency services and care” are included as Appendix D. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The EMTALA regulations contain a series of defined terms that are essential to the regulatory scheme.

If    a hospital has outpatient clinics that are listed on and operated under the hospital license (often referred to in California as 1206(d) clinics), the clinics are considered  to be part of the hospital and are subject to EMTALA if they are located on hospital property.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Indent-1 _idGenParaOverride-3">EMTALA does not apply to skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, or rural health clinics that are operated by hospitals, even if the facilities or clinics are listed on the hospital license. These services are billed to the Medicare program under separate provider numbers that are different from the provider number used to bill hospital services. In addition, EMTALA does not apply to hospital-owned suppliers of Medicare services that are billed separately from hospital services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Indent-1 _idGenParaOverride-3">In some instances, a hospital company may operate <a id="_idIndexMarker008"></a>clinics that are separately licensed or exempt from licensing. Examples of licensed clinics in California include “community clinics” and “surgical clinics,” both of which are subject to clinic licensing laws, and are listed on the hospital license or subject to hospital regulations. Examples of clinics that are exempt from licensing include primary care clinics operated by counties or other public agencies, clinics affiliated with teaching institutions, medical care foundation clinics and imaging centers. Licensed and exempt clinics are typically excluded from treatment as a provider-based department of the hospital, even if they are located on hospital property and owned or controlled by the company operating the hospital.</p></li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Practice Tip:</span> A hospital should review its license and billing practices to determine whether its clinics are part of the hospital for billing and cost reporting purposes.

The term intended to distinguish between hospital departments that are held out as services for persons with urgent and emergency medical problems and other hospital departments   that primarily serve scheduled outpatients for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. As discussed below, the distinction is not always clear to providers and patients.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">A <span class="Bold">“dedicated emergency department”</span> is defined in the EMTALA regulations as a hospital department or facility that is located on the hospital campus or <a id="_idIndexMarker010"></a>off-campus, and meets any one of the following tests:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idIndexMarker011"></a><span class="Bold">License Test.</span> The department or facility is licensed by the state in which it is located as an emergency room or department;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idIndexMarker012"></a><span class="Bold">Holding Out Test.</span> The department or facility is held out to the public (by name, signs, advertising or other means) as a place that provides care for emergency medical conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment; or</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idIndexMarker013"></a><span class="Bold">One-Third Test.</span> The department or facility, based on a representative sample of patient visits within the preceding calendar year, provides at least one-third of all of its outpatient visits for the treatment of emergency medical conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment.</li></ol></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>How will CMS determine if a hospital department is a dedicated emergency department under the one-third test?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, CMS has provided guidance to the CMS regional offices and state<a id="_idIndexMarker014"></a> survey agencies to determine whether a hospital department meets the one-third test. The surveyor is directed to select a sample of patient visits to the department that occurred during the previous calendar year. The surveyor will review the facility log, appointment   roster and other appropriate information to identify the patients seen in the department or facility. The surveyor will then review 20 to 50 medical records of patients for diagnoses or presenting complaints; in consultation with the CMS regional office, the surveyor may expand the sample size in order to conduct an adequate investigation. The patient sample will be selected by the surveyor, not the hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The surveyor must then determine the number of patients who “had an emergency medical condition and received stabilizing treatment.” If one-third of the sample cases were for the treatment of emergency conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment, the department or facility will be considered to be a dedicated emergency department. The Investigative Procedures for EMTALA Surveyors portion of   the <span class="Italic">State Operations Manual</span> (Appendix K) notes that this procedure will apply to specialty hospitals (e.g., <a id="_idIndexMarker015"></a>psychiatric facilities), hospitals without a traditional emergency department, and <a id="_idIndexMarker016"></a>urgent care centers. In addition, the procedure may apply to both on-campus and off- campus departments and facilities of the hospital.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Are <a id="_idIndexMarker017"></a>labor and delivery and <a id="_idIndexMarker018"></a>psychiatric services considered dedicated emergency departments under EMTALA?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the preamble to the 2003 regulations, CMS reaffirmed that a dedicated emergency department includes not only what is generally considered to be a hospital’s “emergency room,” but also other departments of hospitals, such as labor and delivery and psychiatric units. As stated by CMS:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-8">Any area of the hospital that offers such medical services to treat individuals in labor to at least one-third of the ambulatory individuals who present to the area for care, even if the hospital’s practice is to admit such individuals as inpatients rather than listing them on an outpatient basis, <span class="CharOverride-6">would</span> be considered a dedicated emergency department. (Emphasis in original) [68 Fed. Reg. 53229]</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In recent years, CMS has been closely looking at freestanding acute psychiatric hospitals to determine whether they operate dedicated emergency departments for “walk-in” or other non-scheduled patients.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a>Are hospital urgent care centers and other ambulatory departments dedicated emergency departments under EMTALA?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idIndexMarker019"></a>In the preamble to the 2003 regulations, CMS rejected a request to exclude hospital urgent care centers from the EMTALA requirements, stating:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-8">We believe that it would be very difficult for any individual in need of emergency care to distinguish between a hospital department that provides care for an ‘urgent need’ and one that provides care for an ‘emergency medical condition’ need ... . As we have discussed above, if the department or facility is held out    to the public as a place that provides care for emergency medical conditions, it would meet the definition of dedicated emergency department. An urgent care center of this kind would fall under this criterion for dedicated emergency department status [68 Fed. Reg. 53431].</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">However, other guidance from CMS suggests that urgent care and other hospital departments that provide drop-in services for urgent and non-urgent conditions are not automatically considered to be dedicated emergency departments. For example, as noted above, the Investigative Procedures for EMTALA Surveyors portion of the <span class="Italic">State Operations Manual </span>states that the procedure to apply the “one-third test” may apply to an urgent care center or other hospital department only if more than one-third of the center’s or department’s patients presented for the treatment of “emergency” conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment. The guidance suggests that patients presenting only for treatment of “urgent” or “non-urgent” conditions on a drop-in basis will not result in the classification of the urgent care center or other department as a dedicated emergency department.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In addition, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> adopted to implement the Medicare Conditions of Participation for hospital outpatient services [42 C.F.R. Section 482.55] note that urgent care clinics may be organized as part of an <a id="_idIndexMarker020"></a>outpatient department or an emergency department. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> then state that an urgent care clinic will be evaluated for compliance with the integration standards for outpatient services (rather than the integration standards for emergency departments) if three conditions are met:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The urgent care clinic is held out to the public as providing only urgent care services and possibly other services;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The hospital clearly advises the public that the urgent care clinic is not an emergency department; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The urgent care clinic does not meet the definition of a dedicated emergency department under EMTALA.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In some states, urgent care centers and similar departments are licensed as outpatient services. For example, in California, an outpatient service is defined as “the rendering of nonemergency health care” to patients [Title 22, California Code of Regulations, Section 70525].</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As indicated in this discussion, there is some confusion as to whether urgent care centers and similar drop-in hospital departments (e.g., an <a id="_idIndexMarker021"></a>occupational medicine clinic) that are not licensed or operated as typical emergency departments are dedicated emergency departments within the meaning of EMTALA. How an urgent care center is held out to the public may be a critical factor in whether an urgent care center is treated as a dedicated emergency department or excepted from EMTALA. This is illustrated in a 2016 court decision that focused on the signage for a hospital-operated urgent care center. The hospital argued that its website clearly stated that its urgent care center was for non-emergency  needs. However, the court noted that the on-site signage for the urgent care center did not distinguish between urgent care and emergent care; therefore, a person driving by the urgent care center (in this instance, with chest pains) would be unlikely to check the website before entering the urgent care center. As a result, the court declined to rule in favor of the hospital based on the patient’s perception from the signage that the clinic would be an appropriate place to receive emergency care. This case, <span class="Italic">Friedrich et at. v. South County Hospital Healthcare System, et al.</span>, is discussed in chapter 14.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> The broad definition of dedicated emergency department requires  a hospital to evaluate all of its ambulatory care departments (on- and off-campus) to identify the services that meet the definition of a dedicated emergency department. In addition to reviewing the volume of drop-in patients, the hospital should also review its website, signage, advertising, other promotional materials, and information disseminated to the public regarding the availability of drop-in services.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a>How does EMTALA apply to a hospital that does not have a dedicated emergency department?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The first subsection of the EMTALA statute triggers the medical screening obligation for an individual who comes to a “hospital that has an emergency department.” However, the second subsection of the EMTALA statute triggers the obligations for further examination and stabilizing treatment and transfers for an individual “who comes to a hospital.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The EMTALA regulations define a <span class="Bold">“hospital with an emergency department”</span> as “a hospital with a dedicated emergency department.” The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> indicate that hospitals that do not provide emergency services must meet the standards of the Medicare Conditions of Participation [42 C.F.R. Section 482.12(f)(2); <span class="Italic">see Appendix E</span>], which require all participating hospitals to have written <a id="_idIndexMarker022"></a>policies and procedures for the appraisal of emergencies, initial treatment within the capability and capacity of the hospital, and appropriate referral of emergency patients to hospitals that are capable of providing the necessary emergency services. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> for Section 482.12(f) require that staff at any hospital location know how to respond to individuals (patients, staff, visitors and others) seeking or in need of medical and psychiatric emergency services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> state that a hospital with a dedicated emergency department  must comply with the medical screening, stabilizing treatment, transfer and other obligations of EMTALA. However, all hospitals participating in the Medicare program, regardless of maintaining a dedicated emergency department, are subject to the Medicare receiving hospital obligation, and must accept an appropriate transfer of an individual with an emergency medical condition who requires specialized capabilities not available at the transferring hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Hospitals (including critical access hospitals) that do not have a physician present in the hospital on a full-time basis must provide a written <a id="_idIndexMarker023"></a>notice to all patients at the beginning of their hospital stay or outpatient visit stating that a physician is not present in the hospital 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The notice must explain how the hospital will meet the medical needs of a patient who develops an emergency medical condition during the course of an inpatient stay or outpatient encounter at a time when no physician is present in the hospital. The law states that an inpatient stay or outpatient encounter is considered to begin with    the provision of a package of information regarding scheduled preadmission testing and registration for a planned hospital admission for inpatient care or outpatient service. Prior to admitting the patient or providing an outpatient service, the hospital must receive a signed acknowledgment from the patient indicating the patient’s understanding that a physician may not be present in the hospital at all times. The notice is a condition of the Medicare provider agreement, a violation of which may result in termination of the agreement.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If a hospital does not have a dedicated emergency department, it is recommended that the hospital consult with its legal counsel to determine:</p><ol>

In the absence of guidance from CMS regarding the effect of appointment reservation programs in the emergency department, the best practice for hospitals is to comply with the EMTALA requirements for patients who sign up for an appointment at a dedicated emergency department.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"></a>Presentation to an On-Campus Hospital Department that is Not a Dedicated Emergency Department</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">If an individual has a scheduled appointment to receive care from a hospital service that is not a dedicated emergency department (e.g., an imaging procedure, laboratory test, physical therapy session or cardiac rehabilitation program), EMTALA does not apply to the patient once he or she has begun an “encounter” with a health care professional in the department. For purposes of EMTALA, an “encounter” is a “direct personal contact” between  a patient and a physician or other caregiver who may order or furnish hospital diagnostic or treatment services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In addition, EMTALA does not apply if the patient, during the course of his or her outpatient encounter, requests or is in obvious need of emergency services (e.g.,, the patient has a cardiac arrest while on the treadmill), even if the patient is moved to a dedicated emergency department for further examination and stabilizing treatment. Instead, CMS will apply the Medicare Conditions of Participation to the examination and treatment rendered to the outpatient if the need for emergency care arises during his or her encounter.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">As an example, CMS has described the hypothetical case of an outpatient who comes  to the physical therapy department for a scheduled appointment. During the encounter, the patient experiences chest pains and lightheadedness, and is taken to the dedicated emergency department for follow-up examination and treatment. Although personnel in the dedicated emergency department may (and should) provide emergency services to the patient in the same manner as any other patient presenting to the department with similar signs and symptoms, the EMTALA obligations will not apply to the patient since the need for emergency care arose during the outpatient encounter in the physical therapy department. Instead, the response by the hospital is subject to the standards of the Medicare Conditions of Participation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">Although not expressly stated in the regulations, it appears that EMTALA applies to an outpatient if he or she requests or is in need of emergency services prior to the encounter or after the encounter is completed (e.g.,, the patient faints or has a medical crisis while leaving the hospital or in the parking lot).</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-5"><span class="Reference-mark CharOverride-3">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-3">42 C.F.R.

In some cases, the referring physician has seen the patient immediately preceding the patient’s arrival at the hospital; in other cases, the physician has not seen the patient prior to his or her arrival at the hospital, but may have provided an ongoing course of treatment to the patient. Occasionally, a patient is directed to meet his or her primary care physician in the emergency department for examination or treatment.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the preamble to the 2003 regulations, CMS reaffirmed that EMTALA applies to any individual who presents to a dedicated emergency department seeking examination or treatment for any medical condition. As noted by CMS, pharmaceutical services in a dedicated emergency department may be for medical conditions, and are therefore subject to EMTALA [68 Fed. Reg. 53235]. EMTALA will apply if an individual presents for injections  or other treatment for a medical condition, even if the individual arrives with orders from an attending staff member. Therefore, hospitals should record these patients in the central log, open a medical record and provide a medical screening examination.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">This position expressed by CMS in the preamble is reinforced in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>. CMS states that if a patient presents to a dedicated emergency department for pharmaceutical services for a medical condition, the hospital “generally” has an EMTALA obligation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The CMS position, however, implies that not all requests by patients presenting to a dedicated emergency department for pharmaceutical services implicate EMTALA, and therefore require a medical screening examination. However, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> do not provide sufficient guidance to determine the categories of medication requests that do not trigger the EMTALA obligations. Hospitals and their medical staffs should also consider regulatory and risk management issues when deciding whether to administer medication in the absence of a medical screening examination for patients presenting to an emergency department for pharmaceutical services. Therefore, the best practice is for hospitals to provide a medical screening examination, and other EMTALA-required services, to patients presenting for pharmaceutical services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">It is noted that EMTALA does not require a hospital to provide medication to patients who,  as a result of the medical screening examination, are determined not to have an emergency medical condition. As stated by CMS, EMTALA does not require a hospital to provide medication to a non-emergent patient “because the individual is unable to pay or does not wish to purchase the medication from a retail pharmacy or did not plan appropriately to secure prescription refills.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">If an individual comes to a hospital department that is not a dedicated emergency department with a prescription or seeking pharmaceutical services, the EMTALA obligations will not apply to the request unless the individual requests or is in obvious need of examination or treatment for what may be an emergency medical condition. In these cases, hospitals should follow their standard policies and procedures for pharmacy services requested by nonemergency patients.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">Although the EMTALA obligations apply to all individuals who present to a dedicated emergency department, hospitals may tailor their medical screenings for patients who   present at a dedicated emergency department for nonemergency services. The scope of the examination is discussed in chapter 3, “Medical Screening Examinations.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-5"><span class="Reference-mark CharOverride-3">F</span>	Reference:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, tag no.

However, CMS has indicated that EMTALA does not apply to individuals who present to a dedicated emergency department and request services that are not an examination or treatment for a medical condition. Some examples of these situations include the following.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker030"></a>Preventive Care Services</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the preamble to the 2003 EMTALA regulations, CMS, without explanation, listed “preventive health services” as one example of a request for services that does not trigger the requirement for a medical screening examination [68 Fed. Reg. 53235]. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> provide three examples of “preventive care services” — immunizations, allergy shots and flu shots.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">However, if a person presenting for these types of preventive care services requests or is in need of an examination for a medical condition, EMTALA may apply and the patient should be treated in the same manner as other patients presenting for emergency services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker031"></a>Blood Pressure Checks</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the past, CMS Region IX has suggested that EMTALA probably does not apply to persons presenting to an emergency department for routine blood pressure checks offered as a community service to all area residents.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> qualify this past advice. As explained by CMS, a hospital may  have a policy or protocol (or, as applicable, a standardized procedure) permitting a qualified professional in a dedicated emergency department to conduct medical screenings within his or her scope of practice. As an example, CMS cites a request for a blood pressure check. If a person presenting for a routine blood pressure check, upon screening, has a reading within normal limits and there are no other signs or symptoms indicating the presence of an emergency medical condition, the hospital is not required under EMTALA to provide services beyond what was needed to determine the absence of an emergency condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">However, if a person presenting for a routine blood pressure check also requests or is in need of an examination for a medical condition, EMTALA may apply and the patient should be treated in the same manner as other patients presenting for emergency services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"></a>Blood Alcohol Tests and Sexual Assault Cases</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the preamble to the 2003 regulations, CMS stated that requests by law enforcement personnel for <a id="_idIndexMarker032"></a>medical clearance of incarcerated patients, or blood alcohol or other tests to   be used as evidence in criminal proceedings, would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the hospital is required to provide a medical screening and other required EMTALA services [68 Fed. Reg. 53235].</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> provide additional direction for hospitals in law enforcement   cases. In general, the “gathering of evidence for criminal law cases (e.g., sexual assault,   blood alcohol test)” does not trigger the requirements for a medical screening examination or other EMTALA required services. However, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> qualify this exemption from EMTALA:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-8">If an individual is brought to the ED and law enforcement personnel request  that emergency department personnel draw blood for a BAT only and [do] not request examination or treatment for a medical condition, such as intoxication, and a <a id="_idIndexMarker033"></a>prudent layperson would not believe that the individual needed such examination or treatment, then the EMTALA’s screening requirement is not applicable to this situation because the request made on behalf of the individual was for evidence. However, if for example, the individual in police custody was involved in a motor vehicle accident or may have sustained   injury to him or herself and presents to the ED, a MSE would be warranted to determine if an EMC exists.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> further clarify that requests for pre-jail clearance trigger the EMTALA obligations, and that hospitals should provide a medical screening examination to determine whether the individual has an emergency medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">With respect to rape and sexual assault cases, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> state that the same principle described above for blood alcohol testing also applies to individuals presenting to a dedicated emergency department in connection with rape or sexual assault.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In summary, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> direct surveyors to review each case on its own    merits to determine whether EMTALA applies to law enforcement requests. In conducting   staff in-service training, hospitals should consider that even if law enforcement personnel do not request medical care for a patient in custody, the EMTALA obligations will be triggered if a prudent layperson would believe that the patient’s behavior or appearance indicates the need to provide examination or treatment for a medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">For further guidance on medical procedures requested by law enforcement, California hospitals should review chapter 6 of CHA’s <span class="Italic">Consent Manual</span>.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"></a>Other Nonemergency Tests</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, CMS states that the presentation by an individual to a  dedicated emergency department for the collection of evidence (e.g., a lab test) does not trigger the EMTALA obligations so long as the request does not include analysis of the lab results or an examination or treatment of the individual.

Similar to nonhospital-owned ambulances, the ambulance cannot be diverted once it arrives on hospital property.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"></a>Nonhospital-Owned Ambulance</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">If a nonhospital-owned ambulance advises a hospital of its intent to transport an individual   to the hospital, the EMTALA regulations permit the hospital to deny access if it is on “<a id="_idIndexMarker035"></a>diversionary status” (i.e., it does not have the staff or facilities to accept any additional emergency patients). If the ambulance still brings the individual to the hospital, the patient is considered to have “come to the emergency department” and the hospital must accept the person and provide a medical screening examination.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In a 2001 9th Circuit Court of Appeal decision, <a id="_idIndexMarker036"></a><span class="Italic">Arrington v. Wong</span>, the court interpreted the EMTALA regulations to mean that a hospital cannot refuse a patient who is en route to a hospital in a nonhospital-owned ambulance unless the hospital is on diversion. In  the <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> case, a patient with “severe respiratory distress” was in a nonhospital-owned ambulance on the way to a hospital when the ambulance personnel contacted the hospital. The emergency physician asked the name of the patient’s physician and told the ambulance personnel that he believed that “it would be okay” to redirect the ambulance to the patient’s aligned facility (in this case, an Army medical center). The total ambulance time with change in direction was 16 minutes. As discussed in chapter 14, “Private Actions to Enforce EMTALA,” the court interpreted the phrase “comes to the emergency department” as including an individual who is en route to the hospital. Since the hospital was not on diversion, the court ruled that the hospital could not redirect the ambulance.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">CMS has informally indicated that it does not consider the <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> decision to be consistent with the EMTALA regulations or binding on EMTALA enforcement.

The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> address the use of hospital helipads under EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">CMS states that the use of a hospital helipad by local ambulance services or other hospitals to transport a patient to a tertiary (or trauma) hospital does not trigger an EMTALA obligation for the hospital that owns the helipad if two conditions are met:</p><ol>
								<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The helipad is being used for the purpose of transit; and</li>
								<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The sending hospital has conducted a medical screening of the patient prior to transporting the patient to the helipad.</li>
							</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">However, the Guidelines state that if the ambulance crew or the patient (while on-site at the hospital with the helipad) requests the medical assistance of the hospital (e.g.,, the patient’s condition has deteriorated or the patient requires intubation), the hospital must provide emergency services consistent with its EMTALA obligations. Some EMS agencies have adopted policies that include standards for a non-destination hospital to which an ambulance may divert during the course of an arranged transport to a trauma center or  other facility. These policies do not override the EMTALA obligations. If the ambulance crew or the patient requests examination or treatment at a non-destination hospital, the EMTALA obligations may apply, and the hospital must enter the patient in the central log, open a patient record, conduct a medical screening, provide treatment within its capability and reconfirm the transfer to the destination facility. In some instances, this may be a very short visit. However, there is risk of an EMTALA violation if the non-destination hospital provides a quick evaluation or treatment of the patient without following the EMTALA requirements.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text"><span class="All-Caps-Bold">Note:</span> CMS has issued two memoranda on the use of emergency transport personnel  on hospital property to hold and monitor an emergency patient pending the availability of services in the emergency department.

For several years, there has been a split in opinion between the federal circuit  courts of appeal as to whether EMTALA applies to inpatients, including the transfer and discharge of inpatients in an unstabilized condition. Prior to the 2003 EMTALA regulations,   the 1st and 6th Circuit Courts of Appeal applied EMTALA to inpatient discharges and  transfers. In contrast, the 4th and 9th Circuit Courts of Appeal declined to extend EMTALA to the treatment, transfer or discharge of inpatients. These cases are discussed in chapter 14, “Private Actions to Enforce EMTALA.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In <span class="Italic">Roberts v. Galen of Virginia, Inc.</span>, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals applied EMTALA to the transfer of an inpatient in an allegedly unstabilized condition to a long-term care facility after   a two-month hospital stay. During oral argument on an appeal of the Court’s decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Solicitor General (on behalf of the federal government) advised    the Court that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services would adopt regulations clarifying whether EMTALA applied to inpatients.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In 2003, CMS addressed the “inpatient” issue by providing that the EMTALA obligations    are terminated when an individual is admitted in good faith for inpatient care in order to stabilize an emergency medical condition. The regulations adopt the definition of “inpatient” in the Medicare Hospital Manual: “a person who has been admitted to a hospital for bed occupancy for purposes of receiving inpatient hospital services.” However, CMS warned  that EMTALA will apply if a hospital admits an emergency patient in bad faith (i.e., to avoid EMTALA requirements), and then inappropriately transfers or discharges the individual without meeting the stabilization requirement.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The EMTALA regulations apply to the interpretation and enforcement of EMTALA by CMS. They are not binding on the courts. In a 2009 decision, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals observed that the regulation excluding inpatients from EMTALA “is contrary to the plain language” of the EMTALA statute. In the case, the inpatient stay occurred prior to the 2003 change in the regulations, so the decision did not strike down the regulation. In 2012, a district court in Texas reached a similar conclusion. The decisions, <span class="Italic">Moses v. Providence Hospital and Medical Ctrs.</span> and <span class="Italic">Liles v.

The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> clarify that emergency patients who are placed in <a id="_idIndexMarker039"></a>observation status are not inpatients, even if they occupy a bed overnight in the observation unit. Therefore, the receiving hospital obligation applies to the transfer of an emergency patient in observation status.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In 2012, CMS confirmed, in commentary, that it was maintaining its current policy that EMTALA obligations end when an individual is admitted in good faith for inpatient care in order to stabilize an emergency medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">Inpatients continue to be subject to the standards and protections of the Medicare Conditions of Participation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-5"><span class="Reference-mark CharOverride-3">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-3">42 C.F.R.
