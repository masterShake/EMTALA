Many facilities do not provide psychiatric services, and don’t have psychiatrists or other mental health professionals on staff who are available to evaluate or treat patients with psychiatric crises. Psychiatric emergency patients may also pose treatment and other challenges, such as security concerns and elopement, that differ from patients seeking treatment for non-psychiatric emergency medical conditions (EMCs). However, the biggest challenge to hospitals has been managing psychiatric patients for hours or days while seeking the placement and transfer of psychiatric patients to specialty facilities.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The EMTALA obligations also collide with state laws permitting detention of individuals for involuntary psychiatric evaluation and treatment, alignment of patients with local networks of designated facilities, and a sometimes bewildering array of county policies and guidance for detention and placement that vary from county to county and, in some instances, may conflict with EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Neither the EMTALA regulations nor the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> address involuntary holds. More than a decade ago, an EMTALA Technical Advisory Group (TAG) identified the conflict of the EMTALA requirements with state laws for involuntary detention and local networks for crisis services. In response, CMS declined to change the EMTALA regulations or the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> to address the conflicts, other than confirming that transferring psychiatric patients under community protocols could violate EMTALA in some cases.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (LPS) enacted California’s mental health involuntary detention laws in 1967. Under LPS, counties have the responsibility, with state approval, to designate facilities (designated facilities) that are authorized to detain, evaluate and treat involuntary psychiatric patients. State law authorizes law enforcement personnel to detain an individual in order to obtain evaluation and treatment of a mental health disorder. In addition, each county has the discretion to designate health professionals (designated professionals) who may write an involuntary hold. The pre-admission process for detention and treatment under LPS is summarized in <a href="EMTALA_Chap6_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor003">II.&#160;“LPS — Summary of California Mental Health Involuntary Detention Laws,” page&#160;6.2</a>.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Statewide oversight of LPS is assigned to the California <a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a>Department of Health Care Services (DHCS). However, the implementation and administration of LPS is primarily a county function. Many counties have adopted their own interpretations of LPS, some of which vary from the interpretations adopted by other counties. The interpretations related to transfers are discussed in <a href="EMTALA_Chap6_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor025">VI.&#160;“EMTALA Obligations for Placement and Transfer of a Patient With a Psychiatric EMC,” page&#160;6.17</a> and other interpretations are discussed in <a href="EMTALA_Chap6_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor034">VIII.&#160;“Common Questions and Issues Related to the Intersection of EMTALA and LPS in Non-Designated Hospitals,” page&#160;6.24</a>.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The complexities of applying EMTALA to psychiatric patients and facilities, and the intersection of EMTALA and state mental health laws, treatment networks and county rules, have resulted in substantial risks to hospitals for EMTALA violations. CMS Region IX has reported that issues regarding psychiatric patients and facilities have high visibility on the CMS radar screen for potential EMTALA violations.

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">LPS establishes processes under which persons who are dangerous to themselves or others, or gravely disabled, due to a mental health disorder, inebriation or the use of narcotics or restricted dangerous drugs, may be involuntarily detained for specific periods of time for evaluation and treatment. LPS also establishes certain rights and procedural protections for persons who are held for involuntary evaluation or treatment.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As noted in the overview, oversight of LPS is assigned to DHCS, which assumed this responsibility in 2012 following the dissolution of the California Department of Mental Health.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">LPS assigns significant responsibilities to counties, including the designation of facilities and professionals who are authorized to evaluate and treat involuntary patients. In the absence of guidance from the state, many counties have adopted their own interpretations of LPS and the application of LPS to involuntary patients, designated facilities and professionals. Therefore, each hospital should consult with its own legal counsel and its county department of behavioral health regarding the interpretations of LPS by the county.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Although amended in 2013, the LPS pre-admission process has remained largely static for the past 50 years. However, psychiatric services and the legal landscape have fundamentally changed.</p>

			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>Summary of the LPS Pre-Admission Process</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The LPS statutory scheme (Sections 5150, 5151 and 5152 of the California Welfare &amp; Institutions Code) establishes a three-step process for an involuntary admission: detention, assessment and admission.</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-3"><span class="Bold">Detention (5150).</span> The first step in the pre-admission process occurs when a peace officer or a designated professional takes a person into custody based on probable cause that the person, due to a mental health disorder, is dangerous to self or others, or gravely disabled.<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Indent-1 _idGenParaOverride-4">A 5150 hold may be applied in any location — at home, on the street, in a clinic or health facility, including an ED. The 5150 hold permits involuntary detention for up to 72 hours in order to provide assessment, evaluation and crisis intervention or placement of the person for evaluation and treatment at a designated facility. The obligations of a peace officer or a designated professional who detains a person under Section 5150 are described in “The Application of a 5150 Hold,” page 6.6.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List"><span class="Bold">Pre-Admission Assessment (5150(c) and 5151).</span> Assessment requires that the professional person in charge of a designated facility, a member of the attending staff or other designated professional must assess an involuntary patient to determine whether the person can be properly served without being involuntarily detained. If the professional concludes that the patient can be adequately served without being detained, the person must be provided evaluation, crisis intervention, or other inpatient or outpatient services on a voluntary basis.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List"><span class="Bold">Admission (5151 and 5152).</span> If the person must be admitted for further evaluation and treatment on an involuntary inpatient basis, the initial stay may not exceed 72 hours. However, an involuntary patient may be discharged before the end of the 72-hour period.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Each of these steps, including definitions of key terms, is described with greater specificity in chapter 3 of the CHA <span class="Italic">Mental Health Law Manual</span>, which also describes the procedural requirements for any continued inpatient stay after an initial 72-hour admission.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a>Designated Facilities</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">What is a designated facility under LPS?</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Under LPS, each county has the responsibility, with DHCS approval, to designate facilities for the evaluation and treatment of involuntarily detained persons. While not required by  LPS, some counties require a designated facility to sign an agreement with the county that describes the conditions of designation. Some county departments of behavioral health have posted on their websites the requirements for facility designation.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In 2013, the Legislature defined the term “designated facility” to include three types of designated inpatient facilities and one category of ambulatory facility.</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-3">The inpatient facilities are defined as general acute care hospitals with psychiatric units, acute psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric health facilities (PHFs). However, there is no legal requirement that an inpatient facility that provides psychiatric services must apply for designation. Therefore, some psychiatric facilities or inpatient units are limited to the admission of patients who voluntarily agree to receive psychiatric services.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The outpatient facility is defined as a certified <a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a>crisis stabilization unit (CSU). A CSU is defined in the Medi-Cal mental health plan regulations as a service lasting less than 24 hours. CSU services include but are not limited to assessment, collateral services<span class="CharOverride-3"><span id="footnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap6_rebuild.html#footnote-005">2</a></span></span> and therapy (each of these terms is also defined in the Medi-Cal mental health plan regulations), which are provided to individuals for a condition that requires a more timely response than a regularly scheduled visit.</li>

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text"><a id="_idIndexMarker005"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker006"></a>DHCS has posted on its website (see reference below) a list of LPS designated facilities divided into three categories — inpatient facilities, outpatient clinics and other types of designated facilities.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Each list is organized by county, and includes the name, address, telephone number, facility type and number of designated beds for each facility. Some types of designated facilities, such as most <a id="_idIndexMarker007"></a>PHFs and CSUs, are not subject to EMTALA, and therefore they are not required to accept the transfer of patients with psychiatric EMCs from hospitals EDs.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As of October 2017, the following designated facilities are listed on the DHCS website:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-3"><span class="Bold">150 county-designated inpatient facilities.</span> The inpatient facilities are located in 34 counties, meaning that there are no designated inpatient facilities in 24 counties. While the list identifies the license type of the facility (general acute, acute psychiatric or PHF), it does not identify facilities that have age limitations, such as children, adolescents or geriatric patients. In addition, the list includes several Veterans Administration facilities, a state hospital and a naval hospital.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List"><span class="Bold">25 county-designated outpatient clinics and CSUs.</span> The outpatient facilities are located in 18 counties. Most of the outpatient clinics are identified as CSUs, although the list also includes one hospital emergency department and one county outpatient service; the four outpatient clinics in Los Angeles County are identified as “urgent care centers.”</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List"><span class="Bold">Six “other types” of designated facilities.</span> All of these facilities are county jail or detention facilities.</li>

			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>Designated Professionals</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Each county has the responsibility to establish procedures for designating professionals who are authorized in the county to detain a person under Section 5150. There are four statutory categories of professionals are listed in Section 5150 who are eligible to be designated by a county:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-3">The professional person in charge of a designated facility for evaluation and treatment;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">A member of the attending staff of a designated facility;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">A member of a mobile crisis team; and</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Other professionals.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The process for designation of professionals varies from county to county. Many counties require professionals to complete a training program, including an exam, prior to receiving designation. Some counties require renewal of the designation at specified intervals. Some counties delegate to designated facilities the ability to designate professionals who are on staff in the facility. Some counties may designate individuals as trainers, who may also train and designate professionals within county guidelines.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The designation of a professional is typically limited to the county making the designation. In some counties, the designation is facility-specific, and the professional does not have designation privileges outside of the facility for which he or she is designated. The same limitation may apply to other counties in which the professional may practice; if a professional is designated in one county, the designation does not apply in another county unless the professional is also designated by the other county.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In most hospitals that are designated facilities, the ED physicians are often designated professionals, and may detain a person under Section 5150. Some counties have also designated ED physicians who work in non-designated hospitals.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Some counties have posted their LPS designation policies on their behavioral health department website. For example, the designation policies for Orange County are posted at <a href="https://media.ocgov.com/gov/health/bhs/mhi/id.asp">https://media.ocgov.co<span class="No-break">m/g</span>o<span class="No-break">v/h</span>ealt<span class="No-break">h/b</span>h<span class="No-break">s/m</span>h<span class="No-break">i/i</span>d.asp</a>.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In addition to designated professionals, peace officers are also authorized by law to detain a person under Section 5150. The statutory authority conferred on a peace officer is considered to be independent of the discretionary designation of professionals by a county.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>The Application of a 5150 Hold</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">What is a “5150”?</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The LPS preadmission process begins with an involuntary hold (or “custody”) that is described in Section 5150. The hold is commonly referred to as a “5150” and persons on a 5150 hold are commonly referred to as “5150s” or “5150 patients.”</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Section 5150 states that a hold may be applied by a peace officer or a designated professional, upon probable cause, that an individual, due to mental health disorder, may be a danger to self or others, or gravely disabled. The hold permits the peace officer or professional to take the person into custody, or cause the person to be taken into custody, for the purpose of obtaining involuntary mental health evaluation and services.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">What is the obligation of a peace officer or designated professional who detains a person on a 5150 hold?</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In 2013, Section 5150 was amended to provide alternative pathways to a peace officer or designated professional to align the detained person with psychiatric services. As amended, the peace officer or designated professional must take, or cause to be taken, the person into custody for a period of up to 72 hours for:</p>

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As discussed in <a href="EMTALA_Chap6_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor034">VIII.&#160;“Common Questions and Issues Related to the Intersection of EMTALA and LPS in Non-Designated Hospitals,” page&#160;6.24</a>, the placement of the words “72 hours” in Section 5150, and their repetition in Section 5151, has resulted in counties taking different positions as to when the 72-hour period begins.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">How is a 5150 Hold Documented?</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">There are several administrative requirements that must be fulfilled by the peace officer or designated professional who detains a person under Section 5150.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-5"><span class="Bold">The 5150 Application.</span> Section 5150(e) requires that a designated facility must receive a written application stating the circumstances under which the person’s condition was called to the attention of the peace officer or the designated professional, and stating that the officer or professional has probable cause to believe that the person is, as a result of a mental health disorder, a danger to self or others or gravely disabled. DHCS has published a form to fulfill this requirement, DHCS 1801 (DMH 302), “Application for Assessment, Evaluation, and Crisis Intervention or Placement for Evaluation and Treatment,” which may be found at <a href="http://www.dhcs. ca.gov/formsandpubs/forms/Forms/Mental_Health/DHCS1801_07142014.pdf">www.dhcs. ca.gov/formsandpubs/forms/Forms/Mental_Health/DHCS1801_07142014.pdf</a>.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The requirement that the application must be delivered to the designated facility along with the person under a 5150 hold has resulted in some controversy or confusion. Some designated facilities have required that the application to be delivered with the patient must be the original signed application. There are anecdotal reports of persons being rejected if they arrive with a copy of the signed application. However, there is no requirement in LPS that the application delivered to the designated facility must be the original signed application.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">One county has addressed the signed application issue. In 2016, Orange County Behavioral Health Services adopted a policy entitled the “Use and Processing of Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (LPS) 515<span class="No-break">0/5</span>585 Form.” Under the policy, “a copy, fax, or scan of the original document [5150 application] is sufficient for the purposes of detaining and transporting an individual.” The same applies to the need to make appropriately documented corrections or revisions to the application. However, the policy adopted by Orange County does not necessarily apply in other counties.</p>

The form of the advisement must be substantially the same as the language of Section 5150(g)(1); the advisement must be in writing if the person cannot understand an oral advisement. The advisement is contained in the 5150 application form (<a id="_idIndexMarker008"></a>DHCS 1801) described above and includes the required language of the advisement.

As of October 2017, OSHPD lists 39 acute psychiatric hospitals operating in the state (excluding state-operated facilities). Most acute psychiatric hospitals are Medicare certified and subject to the EMTALA obligations. However, the scope of the EMTALA obligations of an acute psychiatric hospital depends on whether the psychiatric hospital operates a dedicated emergency department (which is discussed below).<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Indent-1 _idGenParaOverride-4">If an acute psychiatric hospital does not operate a dedicated emergency department, it is not subject to the accepting hospital obligations discussed in this chapter and in chapter 7, “Obligations of Receiving Hospitals.”</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker011"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker012"></a><span class="Bold">Psychiatric Health Facility (PHF).</span> A PHF is an inpatient psychiatric facility that is licensed by <a id="_idIndexMarker013"></a>DHCS. Most PHFs are small facilities (typically 16 licensed beds) that are subject to different requirements than acute psychiatric hospitals, including patient care, staffing, operations and physical plant standards. As of October 2017, OSHPD data indicates there are 35 PHFs operating in California.<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Indent-1 _idGenParaOverride-4">A PHF may apply for Medicare certification from <a id="_idIndexMarker014"></a>CMS as a psychiatric hospital, but it must upgrade its staffing, services and capabilities to meet the Medicare Conditions of Participation. Medicare certification is not required for a PHF to participate in <a id="_idIndexMarker015"></a>Medi-Cal as a mental health provider. As a result, only a few PHFs are certified by the Medicare program. The few PHFs that are Medicare-certified are subject to EMTALA in the same manner as acute psychiatric hospitals. PHFs that are not certified by Medicare are not subject to EMTALA.</p></li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The licensing and certification requirements for psychiatric services and facilities are independent of the county designated facility process. As a result, some licensed psychiatric services or facilities may limit admissions to voluntary patients, and are not designated facilities under LPS.</p>

				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"></a>When does a psychiatric hospital operate a dedicated emergency department?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idIndexMarker016"></a>As discussed in chapter 2, “When and Where Does EMTALA Begin and End?”, a hospital may be found to operate a dedicated emergency department if CMS determines one of the following to be present:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The facility operates a licensed emergency service;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The facility meets the “<a id="_idIndexMarker017"></a>Holding Out Test” because it holds itself out to the public as providing emergency psychiatric services on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment; or</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The facility meets the “<a id="_idIndexMarker018"></a>One-Third Test” because, based on a representative sample of patients within the preceding year, one-third of all of its outpatient visits for the treatment of EMCs were provided on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment. The process by which CMS will determine whether a facility meets the “One-Third Test” is discussed in chapter 2 and described in Appendix K.</li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The analysis applied by CMS to acute care hospitals applies equally to an acute psychiatric facility or a general acute care hospital that maintains an outpatient treatment area for crisis intervention or other psychiatric services that are provided on a drop-in basis without a scheduled appointment.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">An acute psychiatric hospital should expect surveyors, during the complaint survey process, to consider whether the hospital operates a dedicated emergency department. If CMS concludes that the hospital in fact operates a dedicated emergency department, the hospital will be required to comply with all of the EMTALA obligations — signage, central log, opening of medical records and on-call coverage, as well as policies for medical screening examination, necessary stabilizing treatment, and an appropriate transfer (if required) for any individual who presents to the department seeking or in need of examination or treatment for any medical condition.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Similarly, the courts may examine whether an acute psychiatric facility operates a dedicated emergency department. In an October 2017 federal District Court decision in Indiana, the court reviewed a claim brought by a patient alleging suicidal ideation who presented after- hours to a free-standing psychiatric facility. The patient was re-directed by an on-duty security officer to the emergency department of its affiliated hospital that was a mile away. On the way to the hospital, the patient drove his vehicle into an apartment complex in an attempt to commit suicide. The court rejected the facility’s argument that it did not have a dedicated emergency department, noting that the dedicated emergency department need not be on the same campus as the hospital from which an individual may seek care. Regardless of the merits of the EMTALA claim or the court’s rationale in declining to dismiss the EMTALA claim,<span class="CharOverride-3"><span id="footnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap6_rebuild.html#footnote-003">4</a></span></span> acute psychiatric facilities need to have policies and procedures to address patients presenting at all hours seeking or in need of emergency services.</p>

Section 482.12(f)). Under the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> for Section 482.12(f), the hospital must have appropriate written policies and procedures that address the following:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The appraisal of emergencies, including the immediate availability at all times of a registered nurse who has training to conduct an assessment that enables the nurse to recognize the need for emergency care;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The provision of initial treatment needed by persons with EMCs within the hospital’s capability and capacity.

The hospital must also send the necessary medical information with the individual to the receiving hospital.</li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The requirements of Section 482.12(f) do not apply to a PHF, unless the PHF has been certified as a participating provider in the Medicare program.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> <a id="_idIndexMarker020"></a>CMS has indicated that it will closely scrutinize the actions of acute psychiatric hospitals that are Medicare-certified and that do not offer walk-in or other emergency services if they refuse to assist an individual seeking entrance for evaluation of a potential EMC. Even if the facility does not operate a dedicated emergency department, CMS will review the hospital’s response under the Medicare Conditions of Participation</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Psychiatric hospitals should also review their state law obligations to respond to emergency situations. Under California law, a hospital that does not operate an ED must exercise reasonable care to determine whether an emergency exists and direct the person to a nearby facility that can render the needed services, and assist the person in obtaining needed services, including transportation, in every way reasonable under the circumstances. In addition, hospitals that are designated facilities to evaluate and treat 5150 patients (danger to sel<span class="No-break">f/o</span>thers or gravely disabled) may have additional obligations to provide psychiatric evaluation and treatment.</p>

				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"></a>If a <a id="_idIndexMarker021"></a>psychiatric hospital or a hospital with a psychiatric service limits admissions to voluntary patients, and is not a designated facility, must it admit or accept the transfer of involuntary patients?</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Psychiatric facilities and services voluntarily establish limits on their service capabilities and admission policies, including designation under LPS. Dating back to 1994, CMS stated in the preamble to the EMTALA regulations that “[n]either the statute nor the regulations mandate that hospitals expand their resources or offer more services. Rather, they focus on a hospital’s existing capabilities.” 59 Fed.Reg. 32086 (June 22, 1994). It has therefore been generally believed that psychiatric services and facilities that admit only voluntary patients, and are not designated facilities, are not required under EMTALA to admit or accept transfers of involuntary patients.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In a June 2017 settlement, the OIG, following a CMS Region IV EMTALA investigation, determined that a South Carolina acute care hospital that maintained a “voluntary” psychiatric unit allegedly violated EMTALA by not providing psychiatric examination and treatment in the ED for emergency psychiatric patients, and maintained “involuntary” psychiatric patients in the ED and did not admit them to its voluntary psychiatric unit. The OIG reported that there were 36 incidents of individuals with psychiatric EMCs. These patients were reportedly not evaluated by on-call psychiatrists, and were involuntarily committed and kept in the ED for 6 to 38 days, despite available beds in its voluntary unit. The patients were described as ranging in age from young adults to elderly adults, and with suicidal or homicidal conditions. The hospital settled the investigation with the OIG for $1,295,000.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The hospital reportedly had limited admissions to voluntary patients for over 30 years under hospital-approved policies. The conclusions by CMS and the OIG as the hospital’s capability to admit the patients appear to be contrary to the CMS guidance quoted above as to hospitals determining their own capability and not being required to expand their services.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">It is difficult to evaluate whether the investigation and settlement of this case is an anomaly, or whether the investigation by CMS and the OIG reflects a change in policy or interpretation of EMTALA. In California, involuntary patients must be admitted to a designated facility for evaluation and treatment. It is unclear if CMS or the OIG would apply the same interpretation so as to require acceptance by a voluntary facility of a transfer of an involuntary patient with a psychiatric EMC, or admissions or transfers conflicting with other facility or service limitations such as age.</p>

(See chapter 3 for more information regarding the hospital designation of health care professionals who may provide the MSE.)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">CMS has cited hospitals for failing to conduct an appropriate psychiatric screening examination for a patient with a presenting complaint of a psychiatric nature. In conducting the psychiatric screening, the ED physician or other screening professional cannot rely solely on a crisis team member or other non-hospital professional (even if a designated professional) to perform the screening. Although hospitals may utilize the resources of crisis teams and designated professionals for further examination and observation of psychiatric patients, the ED physician or other hospital personnel must provide a clinical evaluation as part of the MSE.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip ParaOverride-6"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> Hospitals must continue to screen and monitor individuals with potential psychiatric emergencies until their departure from the hospital.

			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">While there are some similarities between a psychiatric EMC under EMTALA and detention under Section 5150, the nature of these determinations is not the same:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">A psychiatric EMC is based on a clinical judgment by an ED physician or other qualified professional as to the nature and severity of a person’s medical and/or psychiatric conditions.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">A 5150 hold is based on probable cause by a peace officer or designated professional (who may or may not be a physician) to detain a person for psychiatric evaluation and treatment. The determination of probable cause, especially by a peace officer, does not, and is not intended to include the elements of an MSE or the professional judgment of an ED physician.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As a result, there is no bright line standard that all patients on a 5150 hold must be considered to have a psychiatric EMC. Some individuals may present to the ED on a 5150 hold written by a peace officer and may, upon medical screening an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r subsequent evaluation and monitoring, be determined by an emergency physician not to have a psychiatric EMC within the meaning of EMTALA or California law. Conversely, there is no bright line standard that a person determined to have a psychiatric EMC meets the probable cause to apply a 5150 hold, especially if the individual is voluntarily seeking treatment for his or her psychiatric condition. Each psychiatric emergency patient must be evaluated based on hi<span class="No-break">s/h</span>er individual signs and symptoms, without regard to whether a 5150 hold is in place or should be in place.&#9;</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Notwithstanding these differences, in a 2012 CHA webinar, a <a id="_idIndexMarker028"></a>CMS representative noted that an EMTALA surveyor may use a 5150 hold as a factor in determining whether there is a psychiatric EMC. However, the existence of a 5150 hold is not the sole or determining factor as to whether a person has a psychiatric EMC. The judgment of the treating ED physician, as documented in the medical record, is the basis for determining the presence or absence of a psychiatric EMC and whether the condition is stabilized. Regardless of the presence of a 5150 hold, the treating physician’s judgment should override the significance of the 5150 hold if the physician, based on his or her examination of the patient, determines that the patient does not have a psychiatric EMC or that the EMC is stabilized.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> The lack of clarity from CMS on the relationship of 5150 holds and EMTALA places non-designated hospitals at risk of an EMTALA violation with respect to the treatment and discharge of patients on a 5150 hold, and whether the patients are transferred in accordance with EMTALA standards. As a result, hospitals should continue to evaluate and monitor the status of the individual during his/her stay in the ED, including times that the individual is in the custody of a designated professional or in observation status. Hospitals should also consider The Joint Commission standards for boarding psychiatric patients awaiting placement at designated facilities (see reference below). Until CMS provides more definitive guidance on psychiatric transfers, it is recommended that transfers of psychiatric emergency patients on a 5150 hold comply with EMTALA standards described in Chapter 5.</p>

Consistent with EMCs of a non-psychiatric nature, the view of CMS appears to be that a psychiatric EMC is considered stabilized when it is determined that no material deterioration of the condition is likely, within reasonable medical probability, to result during the transfer or discharge of the patient from the facility.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">There is a bit of guidance from <a id="_idIndexMarker031"></a>CMS on the stabilization of psychiatric conditions. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> note that the administration of chemical or physical restraints during transfer may “stabilize” a psychiatric patient for a period of time and temporarily resolve the underlying EMC, but that the condition may be exacerbated if the condition is not treated. Therefore, CMS recommends that providers “should use great care when determining if the medical condition is in fact stable after administering chemical or physical restraints.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">If a patient’s psychiatric EMC is resolved, the patient may be discharged, especially if the patient is not subject to a 5150 hold. As with a medical patient, the hospital must provide the patient with discharge instructions, including a plan for follow-up care.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Under California law, a patient’s psychiatric EMC is considered to be stabilized if, in the opinion of the treating physician or other qualified professional, the patient’s psychiatric EMC has reached the point where, within reasonable medical probability, no material deterioration of the patient’s psychiatric EMC is likely to result from, or occur during, the transfer of the patient. The California law essentially follows the EMTALA test for establishing when an EMC is stabilized. In addition, California law requires providers to provide a written aftercare plan for mental health patients. Details about the required aftercare plan are found in CHA’s <span class="Italic">Mental Health Law Manual</span>.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">If a patient has been released from a 5150 hold by a designated professional, the hospital should request that the professional provide his or her recommendations for follow-up evaluation and treatment. In one case, a hospital was cited for failing to comply with EMTALA when a patient released from a 5150 was ready for discharge late in the evening. In this instance, the patient lived a considerable distance from the hospital (e.g., over 25 miles) and refused to seek transportation assistance from a family member or a friend. The hospital was subsequently cited by CMS because it “… did not fully implement the stabilizing measures  as determined by the mental health crisis worker … The stabilizing measures identified by … [the crisis worker] … were located in Patient 1’s home town and Patient 1 was discharged without a means to get to her home…”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>&#9;References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-9">42 C.F.R.

			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The decisions as to the stabilization of a psychiatric EMC and the release of a 5150 hold are independent of each other, and a treating physician cannot rely solely on the judgment of a designated professional to apply or release a 5150 hold.</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">A clinical determination by an ED physician or other qualified professional that a person’s psychiatric EMC is stabilized does not automatically release a 5150 hold previously applied to the patient, or the need to place the person at a designated facility for further evaluation and treatment.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Conversely, the decision by a designated professional to release a 5150 hold on an ED patient does not directly affect the clinical determination of an ED physician or other qualified professional as to whether the patient’s psychiatric EMC is stabilized. For example, a patient may have an unstabilized psychiatric EMC, but be willing to stay for voluntary evaluation or treatment, and thus not need to be on 5150 hold.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The treating physician or other qualified professional has the responsibility to make an independent determination as to whether an individual has a psychiatric EMC, whether the condition is stabilized, and whether the individual’s condition is stabilized for purposes of transfer or discharge. The treating physician may consider, but cannot solely rely on, the findings of a designated professional who is not on staff at the hospital to determine whether a psychiatric EMC is stabilized. Similarly, the treating physician cannot base his or her decision to consider a psychiatric EMC to be stabilized if the designated professional who is not on staff at the hospital releases a 5150 hold.</p>

The strongest statement in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> is a warning that EMTALA supersedes inconsistent state or local networks for patient screening or treatment:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-8">Hospitals are not relieved of their EMTALA obligation to screen, provide stabilizing treatment and/or an appropriate transfer to individuals because of prearranged community or State plans that have designated specific hospitals to care for selected individuals (e.g., Medicaid patients, psychiatric patients, pregnant women). Hospitals located in those States which have State/local laws that particular individuals, such as psychiatric or indigent individuals, are to be evaluated and treated at designated facilities/hospitals may violate EMTALA if the hospital disregards the EMTALA requirements and does not conduct an MSE and provide stabilizing treatment or conduct an appropriate transfer prior to referring the individual to the State/local facility ... Hospitals are also prohibited from discharging individuals who have not been screened or who have an emergency medical condition to non-hospital facilities for purposes of compliance with State law. The existence of a State law is not a defense to an EMTALA violation for failure to provide an MSE or failure to stabilize an EMC therefore [sic] hospitals must meet federal requirements or risk violating EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In a different section of the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, CMS advises that patient health status frequently depends on the appropriate use of community plans (such as trauma and psychiatric hospitals). The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> emphasize that the appropriate transfer of an emergency patient to a trauma or other regional treatment facility in accordance with community-wide protocols will be deemed to comply with EMTALA in instances where the hospital cannot provide stabilizing treatment.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">EMTALA enforcement actions have focused on the actions of the hospital in providing the psychiatric assessment as part of the MSE and continued monitoring of psychiatric patients until departure from the hospital. The results of these surveys indicate that hospitals must conduct their own psychiatric assessment as part of the MSE and monitor the patient during the entirety of the stay in the ED.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">If the patient requires stabilizing treatment beyond the capability or capacity of the treating hospital, the hospital should document compliance with the standards for an appropriate transfer under EMTALA <span class="Italic">(see chapter 5, “Transferring or Discharging an Emergency Patient”)</span>. As part of providing further examination and stabilizing treatment to an individual who has been determined by the treating physician to have a psychiatric EMC, the hospital may consider, but it is not bound by, county or other regional behavioral health networks for psychiatric evaluation, observation and placement. However, the hospital must maintain oversight and control of the patient until his or her departure from the hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-5"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>&#9;References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-7">42 C.F.R.

Under the EMTALA regulations, a sending hospital may arrange an appropriate transfer of an individual with any EMC, whether medical or psychiatric, to any facility that has the capacity and capability to stabilize the individual’s EMC. Conversely, an accepting hospital cannot refuse an appropriate transfer from an ED of an individual with an EMC, whether medical or psychiatric, if it has the capacity and capability to stabilize the individual’s EMC.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-10">The obligations for the transfer of patients with EMCs are described in chapter 5 of this manual, and the obligations for receiving hospitals to accept the transfer of patients with EMCs are described in chapter 7 of this manual.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"></a>Must a hospital transfer patients with an unstabilized psychiatric EMC to designated facilities aligned with the local county?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In some counties, a designated professional who has custody of a 5150 patient in a non- designated ED may assist or attempt to direct the hospital in the placement of the patient with a designated facility. While this effort may be helpful to hospital staff, most designated professionals, especially county personnel, are often under instructions from the county to place patients only in facilities that are designated by that county or for which the county has placement arrangements. For example, in one California county, a LPS training manual posted on its behavioral health department website states the following: “Sending 5150 detainees to hospitals NOT designated by [the department]is illegal.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">Regardless as to whether the above statement is a correct statement of the LPS law, it does not override EMTALA if an ED patient has a psychiatric EMC that is not stabilized, as determined by the treating physician. Per the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-8">Community plans are designed to augment physician’s care if the necessary services are not within the capability of the hospital <span class="Bold">but does not mandate patient care nor transfer patterns.</span> (emphasis added)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">Under EMTALA, there are no geographic or designated facility limitations on the transferring physician and hospital in finding and arranging facility placement and transfer, so long as the patient is transferred to a facility located within the boundaries of the United States.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In a 2013 memorandum, CMS noted a concern as to payors requiring approval of an individual with an EMC as a condition for transfer to another facility, including directing the destination of the individual to a specific facility. The rationale of the memorandum should apply equally to counties, especially as each county operates the local Medi-Cal mental health plan, and may attempt to direct or limit facility placement.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The memorandum addresses stabilization of EMCs and transfers:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">As to stabilization of an EMC, the memorandum warns that some payors may assume that a person who is “clinically stable” for transfer is no longer covered by EMTALA. This may be applicable to psychiatric patients who are medically clear, but are still perceived by the treating physician as having a psychiatric EMC. Per CMS, if an ED patient has an EMC, including a psychiatric EMC, that is not been stabilized as determined by the treating physician, the patient is still covered by EMTALA:<p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-11">“Stable for transfer” is not a term used in EMTALA, and it is not necessarily equivalent to the term “stabilized,” as defined for EMTALA purposes … although the individual may be “stable for transfer,” he/she nevertheless has an unstabilized EMC, and remains protected under EMTALA before, during and after the transfer.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">As to transfers, the memorandum warns hospitals as to potential third-party interference in transfers of EMTALA patients:<p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-11">Anecdotally we have become aware of some third-party payors with policies or proposed policies that seem to assume, incorrectly, that any individual for whom a transfer is being planned has been “stabilized,” and thus is no longer protected under EMTALA. As indicated above, this is incorrect, and procedures for a third-party payor to intervene in the transfer decisions regarding an individual protected under EMTALA could, if adhered to by hospitals, place them at risk of violating EMTALA.</p></li></ol></li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In summary, the EMTALA transfer rules for an individual with an unstabilized EMC, whether medical or psychiatric, are the same. The transferring hospital may arrange an appropriate transfer of an individual with an unstabilized psychiatric EMC to any facility that has the capacity and capability to stabilize the individual’s psychiatric EMC. The transfer of an ED patient with an unstabilized psychiatric condition may be arranged with any facility within or outside of the county in which the sending hospital is located, as well as across state lines, if necessary, in order to find a facility that has the capacity and capability to stabilize the emergency psychiatric condition.</p>

In some cases, a county behavioral health department or mental health plan may seek to limit the number of admissions of involuntary patients at a contracting facility; however, if the contracting facility has an available bed and the capability and capacity to stabilize a psychiatric patient’s condition, it cannot decline the transfer due to the limitations imposed by the county or health plan. Similarly, if it has the capacity and capability to stabilize the individual’s EMC, it cannot refuse acceptance of an ED patient with an unstabilized psychiatric conditions who is transferred across county lines or otherwise to an out-of-network facility.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 ParaOverride-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"></a>Can a hospital transfer a patient with a psychiatric EMC to a PHF or a crisis stabilization unit?</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text"><a id="_idIndexMarker032"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker033"></a>The EMTALA statute and regulations repeatedly apply to “hospitals” for compliance with the EMTALA obligations for providing a MSE, making an appropriate transfer and accepting an appropriate transfer of an individual with an EMC. However, the EMTALA statute and regulations, in describing the standards for an appropriate transfer, do not refer to the receiving provider as a “hospital.” Rather, the statute and regulations refer to the receiving provider more broadly as a “medical facility.” The use of the term “facility” rather than “hospital” suggests that EMTALA permits a hospital to transfer an EMTALA patient, i.e., an individual with an unstabilized EMC, to a facility that is not a hospital so long as the receiving facility has the capability and capacity to stabilize the EMC. As pertinent to psychiatric emergency patients, the reference to a “medical facility” could be interpreted to permit hospitals to transfer an EMTALA patient to a PHF or a CSU even if they are not considered to be “hospitals.”</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In November 2009, CMS Baltimore headquarters, in a letter to the author of this manual, indicated that there are circumstances in which a hospital could transfer an EMTALA patient to a CSU. The CMS letter (Appendix V) cautions that each case must be reviewed based on the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The specific facts of the case;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The clinical condition of the patient;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The certification for transfer by the transferring physician and other pertinent information; and</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Whether the CSU has the capacity and capability to stabilize the EMC.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Based on the CMS letter, the sending physician, in addition to meeting all of the requirements for an appropriate transfer, must determine that the CSU has the capacity and capability to stabilize the EMC of each specific patient. The CMS letter recommends that hospitals seeking to transfer EMTALA patients to a CSU should develop transfer policies to assess the capabilities of the CSU to stabilize an EMC.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The number of CSUs in California has continued to grow in the past few years, and more CSUs will be opening as a result of state grant funds to expand the number of CSUs. Most CSUs are not licensed by the state or under the jurisdiction of CDPH; rather, they operate under certification by DHCS and LPS designation by the counties.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">While the 2009 CMS letter indicates that a CSU may be a resource for placement of psychiatric patients, recent surveys of transfers to CSUs by some hospitals have drawn skepticism from some CDPH surveyors. Some surveyors have expressed concern whether the transfer of a patient with a psychiatric EMC should be made to an ambulatory facility that is limited to keeping the patient less than 24 hours. In two cases, statements of deficiencies have been issued by CMS to hospitals for transferring a psychiatric patient to a CSU. In one instance, the patient was subsequently transferred back to the sending hospital. In the second case, the patient was subsequently transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility for an inpatient admission.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">A CSU may be able to provide psychiatric evaluation and crisis services, which is a higher level of care than some EDs. However, the statement of deficiency reflects a view that a receiving CSU must be able to stabilize the psychiatric EMC. It cannot be an interim stop between the ED and an inpatient psychiatric admission.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The following are recommendations for CSU transfers:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-3">Develop a transfer agreement with the CSU that sets forth the criteria of the CSU for accepting emergency psychiatric patients and other information that will facilitate the decision-making process by the treating physician.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Expect that a surveyor will query the sending hospital and treating physician as to their knowledge of the admitting criteria and the service limitations of a CSU.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Work closely with the CSU to identify the types of patients whose psychiatric EMCs may be stabilized by a transfer to it within the 24-hour limitation, and conversely, the signs and symptoms, or manifestations of behavior, for persons who should not be considered for the CSU placement.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Be selective in identifying patients for a CSU transfer and discuss the case in sufficient detail with the CSU to verify the appropriateness of the placement.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">If a CSU transfer is implemented, document the reasons for transferring a patient with a psychiatric EMC to a CSU, including the expectation that the psychiatric EMC can be stabilized at the CSU.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Conduct periodic QAPI reviews of CSU transfers in collaboration with the CSU, and use the findings for improvements in patient selection and the CSU transfer process.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">While the CMS letter permits, in selective circumstances, the transfer of an individual with a psychiatric EMC to a CSU, it must be remembered that a CSU is not a hospital. Therefore, the CSU has no obligation to accept the transfer of an EMTALA patient regardless of its capability and capacity.</p>

			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Effective Jan. 1, 2010, the California hospital emergency services laws were amended to address the transfer of a health plan member who has a psychiatric EMC.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The Assembly Health Committee analysis of the legislation that enacted Health and Safety Code Section 1317.4a, describes the following reasons for the legislation:</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style">According to the author, this bill is needed to clarify that the treatment necessary to relieve or eliminate a psychiatric emergency may include inpatient admissions. The author states that hospitals have been denied payment for claims by health plans in cases where the hospital treated a mental health emergency with an inpatient admission. The author states that there have been instances where a health plan automatically denies a claim for a psychiatric inpatient admission based on the fact that the patient did not have prior authorization. The author points out that health plans are already obligated to pay for the care and treatment necessary to alleviate the emergency, which in the case of a psychiatric emergency may include an inpatient psychiatric admission. The author argues that this bill will prohibit health plans from denying payment for appropriate treatment of a psychiatric medical emergency.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Under Section 1317.4a, the emergency services and care required to relieve or eliminate a psychiatric EMC is defined to include a possible admission or transfer to a psychiatric unit of a general acute care hospital or an acute psychiatric hospital. It is noted that the statute does not include transfers to a PHF or a CSU, each of which may be an appropriate facility for the transfer of an emergency psychiatric patient.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If the patient is on a 5150 hold, a transfer cannot be made in a manner that conflicts with the requirements of the involuntary detention and treatment rules of LPS that are described in this chapter.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Section 1317.4a permits a hospital to transfer a psychiatric emergency patient to another hospital in accordance with the procedures described below.</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Section 1317.4a applies only if, “in the opinion of the treating provider, the patient’s psychiatric emergency condition has reached the point that, within reasonable medical probability, no material deterioration of the patient’s psychiatric emergency condition is likely to result from, or occur during, the transfer of the patient.”<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Indent-1 _idGenParaOverride-4"><span class="Bold">Comment:</span> The language quoted above is virtually identical to the definition of “stabilized” under the EMTALA statute and regulations. As a result, it appears that transfers under Section 1317.4a of emergency patients with psychiatric EMCs are limited to patients who have been determined to have stabilized psychiatric EMCs. This appears to be confirmed by another subsection of Section 1317.4a that does not require authorization for emergency services if doing so is not required by law.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Indent-1 _idGenParaOverride-4">Therefore, a literal reading of Section 1317.4a is that the procedures described in Section 1317.4a do not necessarily apply to the transfer of a patient with a psychiatric EMC that is not stabilized in the judgment of the treating physician.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">If the hospital proposes a transfer of a health plan enrollee with a stabilized psychiatric EMC, the hospital must do both of the following:<ol><li class="Body-Styles_Alpha-list _idGenParaOverride-13">The hospital must document in the medical record its attempt to obtain the name and contact information of the patient’s health plan.

				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The notification to the health plan or the contracting medical provider is required to be made only once, so long as the health plan or the contracting medical provider is able to reach a representative of the hospital if it returns the call.

				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">If the receiving hospital accepts and admits the patient, the receiving hospital must notify the health plan of the transfer. If the receiving hospital does not have a contract with the health plan, the health plan may require and make provision for the transfer of the patient to a hospital that has a contract with the health plan so long as the patient’s psychiatric EMC is stabilized.</li>

				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"></a>Common Questions and Issues Related to the Intersection of EMTALA and LPS in <a id="_idIndexMarker035"></a>Non-Designated Hospitals<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">When LPS was enacted in 1967, the legislature intended that individuals detained under Section 5150 would be routed directly to designated facilities. For example, the LPS pre- admission process contemplates a direct handoff from a peace officer to personnel at a designated facility. In addition, Section 5150.1 prohibits a designated facility from refusing to accept the custody of the person from a peace officer if the facility does not have available beds. Similarly, Section 5150.2 prohibits a designated facility from detaining a peace officer longer than the time necessary to complete the documentation of the detention. Further, Section 5150(c) states that the assessment by a designated professional of a person detained by a peace officer shall not be interpreted to require the peace officer to perform any additional duties other than specified in Sections 5150.1 and 5150.2.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">In addition, a literal reading of Section 5150(a), as amended in 2013, suggests that a person who is involuntarily detained must be diverted either for psychiatric assessment, evaluation and crisis intervention, or placed in a designated facility for evaluation and treatment. Nothing in Section 5150(a) implies a third option or a gap in the process under which the detained individual may be taken to location (such as an ED of a non-designated hospital) that does not provide psychiatric evaluation and crisis intervention, or to a non-designated facility for psychiatric evaluation and treatment.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The diversion of individuals on a 5150 hold to non-designated hospitals is neither addressed nor contemplated in LPS. In the absence of any guidance from DHCS, counties have filled the vacuum with an array of conflicting viewpoints on the interpretation of LPS and strategies for engaging or not engaging with non-designated hospitals.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The most common questions are addressed below:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">When does the 5150 hold clock start?</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">What is the custodial status of a person on a 5150 hold if the peace officer or designated professional leaves the person in a non-designated hospital?</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Can a 5150 hold be released by an ED physician and other staff personnel if they are not designated professionals?</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">If the 5150 clock starts at the time of the hold, and a patient is not transferred within 72 hours, can a new 5150 hold be applied to the person?</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">If the patient is admitted for acute inpatient medical care, does the 5150 hold continue in place?</li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The questions above do not include another frequent question, which is whether counties can restrict or direct transfers of non-designated hospital ED patients to specific facilities. That question is addressed above.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The reason these questions continue to arise is that there are no definitive answers, either in LPS, or in judicial decisions or Attorney General opinions. The discussion of these questions below is therefore intended to explain the issues and provide what little guidance there is available in an effort to assist non-designated hospitals in managing involuntary patients.</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"></a>When does the 72-hour clock begin?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">This should be an easy question to answer since the 72-hour period has been in LPS for 50 years. Alas, there is not a clear answer that is universally accepted by all stakeholders in the LPS process.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The short answer is that there is a difference of opinion between counties, patient and disability rights advocates and other stakeholders as to the start of the 72-hour clock. As noted above, the reason for the disparity of views on this topic is that the 72-hour standard is mentioned twice in the preadmission sections of LPS: first, in Section 5150(a) related to the initial detention of a person, and second, in Section 5151 related to the admission of a person by a designated facility.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The alternate views on the question may be best explained by an FAQ on the website of the North Coast Emergency Medical Services Agency that serves the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt and Lake:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-8">The law has two conflicting statements as to when the clock starts – one statement is found at WIC 5150 and the other (conflicting) statement is found at WIC 5151. Reasonable minds differ on this topic and until it is resolved by the legislature or a court, no one particular view is “correct.” Lawmakers anticipated that little or no time would elapse between the writing of the 5150 and admittance into the designated Psychiatric Health Facility, designated Acute Psychiatric Hospital, or inpatient psychiatric unit in a General Acute Care Hospital. In the real world of today, individuals may wait 24-36 hours just to get admitted into a psychiatric facility. It may be interpreted that the 5150 clock starts when the 5150 document is written or at the time of admittance to the psychiatric facility.<span class="CharOverride-3"><span id="footnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap6_rebuild.html#footnote-001">6</a></span></span></p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In general, a majority of counties start the 72-hour clock under Section 5150 at the time that a person is first taken into custody or the time written on the application for the 5150 hold.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">However, several counties (such as the Counties of Los Angeles and San Bernardino, and the two counties mentioned in the North EMSA FAQ) consider that the 72-hour clock starts under Section 5151 when a person is involuntarily detained in a designated facility.<span class="CharOverride-3"><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap6_rebuild.html#footnote-000">7</a></span></span> These counties appear to start the 72-hour clock based on the two options under Section 5150 that follow the initial detention of a person:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The 72-hour clock starts at the time of involuntary detention if the person is provided assessment, evaluation and crisis intervention,</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">But if the person is placed in a designated facility for evaluation and treatment, the 72-hour clock starts at the time of arrival, or assessment or admission of the person at the designated facility.</li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In addition to the differing views of the counties, disability rights and some patient advocates take a more restrictive view that the 72-hour clock starts at the time of the initial detention, regardless of the course taken by the peace officer or designated professional under the options above or the diversion of the person to a non-designated hospital ED.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Until the law is changed, or there is a judicial decision or Attorney General opinion, the conflicting statements by the counties about the start of the 72-hour clock are likely to remain unresolved. Each hospital should consult its own legal counsel or county department of behavioral health to verify the start-of-the-clock interpretation in the county of the hospital. Hospitals are also advised to ascertain the clock-start interpretations in adjacent counties to which 5150 patients may be transferred.</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"></a>What is the custodial status of a person on a 5150 hold if the peace officer or designated professional leaves the person in a non-designated hospital?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">While LPS applies to persons who are involuntarily detained, its provisions for evaluation and treatment apply only to services provided in designated facilities and by designated professionals. As noted above, the LPS pre-admission process does not contemplate an intervening transit of a detained person to the ED of a non-designated hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">There is no guidance in the law as to whether the involuntary detention of a person continues if the person having custody of the individual leaves the person in a non-designated hospital without another peace officer or designated professional assuming the custody of the person. In many counties, emergency physicians or other licensed personnel practicing in a non-designated facility are not designated professionals and are not authorized to write, enforce or release a 5150 hold.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">Some counties have offered guidance on this question. In November 2016, Orange County Behavioral Health Services advised all hospitals in the county of its view that a 5150 hold on a person who is in a non-designated hospital may remain in place only so long as a designated professional (or presumably a peace officer) retains custody of the person in the hospital. The designated professional may transfer custody of the person to another designated professional who is also in the facility. Subsequent to the letter, Orange County revised its LPS designation policies to expand the categories of personnel who may be designated professionals, which includes designated professionals practicing in a non-designated hospital. As discussed below, Orange County also indicated that an ED physician could consider a Health and Safety Code Section 1799.111 hold for up to 24 hours after the 5150 lapses.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-5"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>&#9;Reference:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-7"><a href="https://media.ocgov.com/gov/health/bhs/mhi/id.asp">https://media.ocgov.co<span class="No-break">m/g</span>o<span class="No-break">v/h</span>ealt<span class="No-break">h/b</span>h<span class="No-break">s/m</span>h<span class="No-break">i/i</span>d.asp</a></p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">However, Orange County may be the exception. For example, Los Angeles County has stated in an FAQ that it has no authority to require personnel in a non-designated facility to continue the detention of a person under a 5150 if the detaining authority has left the facility; it recommends that hospitals consult their own legal counsel. Los Angeles County does not generally designate emergency physicians practicing in non-designated hospitals to write 5150 holds.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-5"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>&#9;Reference:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-7"><a href="http://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/dmh/189959_LPSFAQs2015-Sep2815.pdf">http://file.lacounty.go<span class="No-break">v/S</span>DSInte<span class="No-break">r/d</span>m<span class="No-break">h/1</span>89959_LPSFAQs2015-Sep2815.pdf</a></p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">Since there is little definitive guidance on the continuation or enforcement of a 5150 hold by a non-designated professional in a non-designated facility if a peace officer or designated professional is not present, each hospital should consult its county department of behavioral health to determine if the county has a view on this issue. Hospitals should also consult their own legal counsel as to the potential legal risks of continuing and enforcing a 5150 hold by a non-designated professional when a custodial officer or professional has left the patient in the ED.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"></a>Can a 5150 hold be released by an ED physician and or other staff if they are not county-designated professionals?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">LPS contemplates that a person on a 5150 hold can be released by a designated professional following assessment, evaluation and crisis intervention services, or by a member of the attending staff of a designated facility at the time of the pre-admission assessment under Section 5151. In some counties, designated professionals have been authorized to re-evaluate 5150 patients in non-designated hospital EDs, and release the hold if they determine that there is no longer probable cause to detain the person involuntarily. As discussed in <a href="EMTALA_Chap6_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor023">V.&#160;“Stabilization of an Individual With a Psychiatric Emc for Purposes of Transfer,” page&#160;6.15</a>, the decision by a designated professional to release a hold does not alter the hospital’s obligation to comply with the EMTALA obligations for further evaluation and treatment if the patient’s psychiatric condition has not been stabilized.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">As discussed in the preceding question, there is uncertainty about whether a 5150 hold remains in effect if the person is transported to an ED of a non-designated hospital without the continuing presence of a peace officer or designated professional. If the ED physician or other staff professional working in or available to the ED is not a designated professional, there is no guidance in LPS and from most counties as whether the ED physician, if not a designated professional, can enforce the hold if the patient wants to leave the hospital. Conversely, there is no guidance in LPS and from most counties as whether the ED physician, if not a designated professional, can release the hold if he or she determines that there is no longer probable cause to maintain an involuntary hold on the person.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the absence of a change to LPS, or a court decision or other definitive legal guidance, each hospital should consult its county department of behavioral health to determine if the county has a view on the lapse of a 5150 due to absence of a peace officer or a designated professional, or by an ED physician if he or she determines there is no longer probable  cause to detain the person. Hospitals should also consult their own legal counsel about the potential legal risks to the hospital and a non-designated physician or other professional who attempts to release a 5150 hold, or deems the hold lapsed, in the absence of a peace officer or designated professional retaining custody of the person.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"></a>If the 72-hour clock starts at the time of the 5150 hold, and the hold is not released, or the patient is not discharged or transferred to a designated facility within 72 hours, can a new 5150 hold be applied to the person?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">This question addresses the concept of the serial hold. This is another topic for which there is no law or definitive guidance, and there are arguments on both sides of the issue. The issue typically arises when a person on a 5150 hold is held in a non-designated hospital for more than 3 days awaiting placement and transfer to a designated facility.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In some counties where ED patients in non-designated hospitals cannot be placed within 72 hours, a designated professional may be authorized by the county to conduct a new probable cause determination as to whether the person, as a result of a mental health disorder, is still a danger to self or others, or gravely disabled. If there is probable cause, the designated professional may be authorized by the county write a new application for the hold.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">However, patient advocates may take a more limited view. For example, a brochure published by Disability Rights California advises that at the end of the 72 hours, a person who is detained under Section 5150 must be released, have accepted evaluation or treatment on a voluntary basis, or been certified for intensive treatment on an involuntary basis.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">Each hospital is advised to consult its legal counsel if ED patients in a non-designated hospital are awaiting placement and transfer to designated facilities for more than 72 hours, and may be placed on serial 5150 holds. However, even if the 5150 hold must be released as a matter of law, the release of the hold does not alter the hospital’s EMTALA obligation to continue further evaluation and stabilizing treatment so long as the treating physician determines that the psychiatric EMC is not stabilized.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"></a>If an ED patient on a 5150 hold is admitted for acute inpatient medical (non-psychiatric) care, does the 5150 hold continue in place during the inpatient stay?</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">There is no definitive guidance or legal authority as to the status of a 5150 hold if a detained person presenting to an ED is admitted to an acute bed for inpatient medical (non-psychiatric) care.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">However, most counties and commentators appear to adopt the view that the intervening event of an inpatient acute medical stay may impliedly break the involuntary hold. This appears to be based on a break in the LPS process, since placement and transport to a designated facility must be postponed until after the medical need for an acute inpatient stay is resolved. At the time of discharge, the hospital may need to seek a new probable cause evaluation for a 5150 if the discharge plan is to transfer the person to a designated facility for further evaluation and treatment for his or her psychiatric condition.</p>

				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"></a>Health &amp; Safety Code Section 1799.111 — The 24-Hour Hold<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker036"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker037"></a>Separate and very apart from LPS, the Legislature has provided non-designated hospitals an alternative mechanism to applying or arranging for a hold for a psychiatric patient who meets probable cause for involuntary detention.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">In 1996, the Legislature enacted Health &amp; Safety Code Section 1799.111. In summary:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">The statute applies only to non-designated hospitals, and an ED physician or certain other licensed professional staff working in a non-designated hospital;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">The statute provides immunity from civil or criminal liability for applying a hold under the conditions described in the statute, and the subsequent release of the hold under the conditions described in the statute.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">While the statute follows LPS for detaining a patient with a mental disorder who presents a danger to self or others or is gravely disabled, it does not include the administrative duties (application, advisement, etc.) under LPS for a peace officer or designated professional who detains a person under Section 5150.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">The statute is located at the end of the laws governing the California Emergency Medical Services Agency and pre-hospitalization services. It is not part of LPS or hospital licensing laws, or under the oversight of DHCS or CDPH.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">There are no reported court decisions or Attorney General opinions interpreting or applying Section 1799.111.</li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Section 1799.111 is an immunity statute, meaning that compliance with the conditions for applying or releasing a hold provides civil and criminal immunity from liability for the actions of the hospital and its participating physicians or professional personnel in applying a hold and, if applicable, for the actions of a person after the release of a hold. However, the immunities only apply if all conditions in the statute are met.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The statute is divided into two basic parts — subdivisions (a) and (b) establish the conditions that permit the involuntary detention of a patient in a non-designated facility, and subdivision (c) establishes the conditions under which the detention may be released while the patient is still in the non-designated hospital. There are other sections that follow subdivision (c) that are also discussed below.</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"></a>Application of a Section 1799.111 Hold<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The following conditions must be met to obtain immunity from civil or criminal liability for detaining a person under Section 1799.111:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The hospital must be an acute or psychiatric hospital that is not designated by a county as an evaluation and treatment facility for involuntary patients under LPS.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The licensed professional staff, or physician providing emergency services in any department of the hospital, who detains a person must meet the following conditions for the detention:<ol><li class="Body-Styles_Alpha-list _idGenParaOverride-13">The person cannot safely be released from the hospital because, in the opinion of the treating physician, or a clinical psychologist with staff privileges at the hospital, the person, as a result of a mental disorder, presents a danger to himself or herself, or others, or is gravely disabled; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Alpha-list _idGenParaOverride-13">The hospital staff, treating physician or other licensed mental health professional has made and documented repeated unsuccessful efforts to find appropriate mental health treatment for the person. The telephone calls or other contacts must begin at the earliest possible time when the treating physician has determined when the person will be medically stable for transfer; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Alpha-list _idGenParaOverride-13">The person is not detained at the hospital beyond 24 hours; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Alpha-list _idGenParaOverride-13">There is probable cause for the detention.</li></ol></li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">There are two additional conditions if the person is detained beyond eight hours:<ol><li class="Body-Styles_Alpha-list _idGenParaOverride-13">A discharge or transfer of the person for evaluation or treatment is delayed due to the need for continuous and ongoing care, observation or treatment at the hospital; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Alpha-list _idGenParaOverride-13">In the opinion of the treating physician or clinical psychologist, the person, as a result of a mental disorder, is still a danger to himself or herself, or others, or is gravely disabled.</li></ol></li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The detention of a person under Section 1799.111 does not require the completion of the application used to document a 5150 hold, the formal notice to a patient of his or her detention, or other obligations required under Section 5150. CHA has developed Form 12-12 (Appendix P) to document compliance with these conditions.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The application of a hold under Section 1799.111 does not require the participation of designated professionals, county approval or any reporting to counties of the names of persons detained.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">However, a person held involuntarily under Section 1799.111 retains hi<span class="No-break">s/h</span>er legal rights regarding consent to treatment. Hospitals must also comply with all applicable laws pertaining to restraint, seclusion, and psychiatric medications for persons held involuntarily on a Section 1799.111 hold.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If a person is detained on a Section 1799.111 hold, the person, if later admitted for involuntary treatment at a designated hospital, must be credited the time he or she was detained at the non-designated hospital (i.e., the time must be deducted from the 72-hour clock). It is recommended that a transferring hospital provide to the receiving hospital documentation of the length of time that the person was detained on a Section 1799.111 hold in a non-designated facility.</p>

				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"></a>What are the advantages and disadvantages of a Section 1799.111 hold?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In addition to the civil and criminal immunities provided in the law, the following are some of the perceived advantages of applying a 1799.111 hold:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">There is no county involvement or oversight in the detention or release process.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The hold does not require the application or other paperwork for a 5150 hold, provided the findings are documented in the patient record.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">A 1799.111 hold creates less of a stigma than a 5150 hold, since there is no required reporting to public agencies about a 1799.111 hold, and no legal consequences to the person for having been held under Section 1799.111 (such as weapon possession prohibition).</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">A 1799.111 hold may provide flexibility to a treating physician if he or she believes that the psychiatric condition may be transitory, and may be resolved or sufficiently mitigated within the 24-hour period.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The 1799.111 hold may be released at any time, without a designated professional, if there is no longer probable cause to detain the person.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">A 1799.111 hold and release might also help in triggering authorization and payment for post-stabilization services.</li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The following are some of the perceived disadvantages of applying a 1799.111 hold:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-3">The 1799.111 hold is limited to 24 hours, which may not be sufficient for a person whose psychiatric condition is more acute and for whom placement at a designated facility may take longer than 24 hours.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">There is no legal authority to continue detention under Section 1799.111 after the expiration of the 24-hour period, or to re-start the detention process with a new evaluation and hold for a second 24-hour period.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">It is uncertain whether a county-designated professional will come to the hospital to write a 5150 hold that begins upon or after the expiration of the 24-hour detention period.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">If the placement of the person is arranged with a designated facility, some hospitals report that ambulance companies may be reluctant to transport the person without a subsequent 5150 hold to ensure involuntary detention of the person during the transfer.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">In the absence of a judicial interpretation of Section 1799.111, there is some uncertainty as to the application and breadth of the immunity that is provided by the statute.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">At least one county has indicated that it may be appropriate to detain a person under Section 1799.111 after a person has been held under a 5150 hold. In its November 2016 letter to county facilities, the Orange County Behavioral Health Services expressed the view that a 5150 written by a peace officer or a designated professional automatically lapses in a non- designated hospital if the officer or professional leaves the hospital. The letter indicates that while the 5150 may lapse, the hospital may consider a 1799.111 hold.</p>

Twenty-five of California’s 58 counties have no adult inpatient psychiatric beds.

California’s community mental health system has not been able to compensate for the loss of these beds. Many people with severe mental illnesses are too ill to be treated in a voluntary community setting and the vast majority of community mental health services are not geared to those individuals’ clinical needs. Also, treatment needs have become more complicated with an increased number of those with severe mental illnesses having co-occurring medical conditions such as addictions or chronic physical health conditions coupled with a mental illness.</p>
