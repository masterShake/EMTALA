				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor002"></a>Overview<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker000"></a>Any individual who suffers personal harm as a direct result of a hospital’s violation of EMTALA may bring a civil lawsuit against the hospital, with damages limited to those available under the personal injury law of the state in which the hospital is located. Additionally, any facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital’s violation of EMTALA can obtain damages and equitable relief under applicable state law. No private enforcement action may be brought under EMTALA more than two years after the date of the violation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Under California law, persons suffering personal harm and facilities suffering financial loss from violations of state statute<span class="No-break">s/r</span>egulations may seek civil action, including damages, reasonable attorney fees and other appropriate relief. The attorney general or district attorney may also bring an action to enforce state emergency service laws.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="All-Caps-Bold">Note:</span> Since the enactment of EMTALA, there have been hundreds of reported decisions in EMTALA actions brought by patients against hospitals. The following is an overview of the types of judicial decisions interpreting EMTALA in these civil actions. This summary is intended to provide a sampling of EMTALA cases; it is not a comprehensive review or listing of EMTALA decisions.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor003"></a>Private Actions<ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"></a>A Patient May Bring an EMTALA Action Against a Hospital, Not Against Physicians<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The language and legislative history of EMTALA show that the statute was not intended to provide a private cause of action against physicians. However, many federal EMTALA claims also include state malpractice claims against the physicians involved. The federal courts have shown a willingness to retain jurisdiction of such claims, even when the EMTALA claim has been dismissed.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>Private Actions Against Public Hospitals<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">EMTALA allows any individual who suffers personal harm as a direct result of a violation to initiate a civil action against the hospital for damages (to the degree available under the laws of the state) an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r equitable relief. However, several district court cases and a Sixth Circuit case dismissed EMTALA claims brought by patients against public hospitals. These courts have concluded that in EMTALA, Congress did not convey a clear intent to eliminate a state’s ability to determine which types of cases can be brought against it (or against political subdivisions of the state, such as counties or districts that operate hospitals) in its courts. If a state voluntarily waives its immunity from EMTALA lawsuits, or does not raise immunity claims in response to a private action against it, an individual can maintain an EMTALA action for money damages against a public hospital.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a>Third-Party Right of Action Against a Hospital<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The EMTALA statute provides that “any individual” who suffers personal harm as a direct result of a violation may initiate a civil action against the hospital. In a groundbreaking decision, the Sixth Circuit recently interpreted “any individual” expansively, to include not just patients or their representatives, but also third parties who suffer personal harm as a direct result of a hospital’s failure to screen or stabilize a patient as required under EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In <span class="Italic">Moses v. Providence Hospital and Medical Ctrs.</span>, 561 F.3d 573 (6th Cir. 2009), the estate of Marie Moses-Irons brought an action for damages alleging that the hospital had violated EMTALA in discharging Moses-Irons’ husband ten days before he murdered her. On Dec. 13, 2002, Moses-Irons took her estranged husband to the emergency room due to physical and psychiatric symptoms including hallucinations, delusions and threatening behavior that she reported to emergency room staff had made her fear for her safety. Her husband was admitted as an inpatient, but was not transferred to the hospital’s psychiatric unit despite physician documentation requesting such transfer. Howard was discharged on Dec. 19, 2002 and murdered Moses-Irons ten days later.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The district court dismissed the action in 2007 without addressing the issue of whether Moses-Irons had standing to sue. However, the Sixth Circuit squarely addressed the issue, holding that the plain language of EMTALA allows any individual, not just a patient, to sue after sustaining personal harm as a direct result of a hospital’s EMTALA violation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The Moses decision marks the first time a federal court has addressed whether non-patients have standing to sue for personal harm under EMTALA. It remains to be seen whether other federal courts will find the decision in the Moses case persuasive. As noted later in this chapter, the court rejected the hospital’s argument that EMTALA did not apply since the husband was admitted as an inpatient; the Sixth Circuit has held in several cases that EMTALA applies to the discharge of inpatients who first presented to the emergency department.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>Procedural Rules and Damages<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>Limitations on Damages</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">A number of federal and state courts have held that state limits on damage recovery for personal injury or malpractice actions apply to EMTALA damages. In <span class="Italic">Barris v. County of Los Angeles</span> (20 Cal.4th 101 (1999)), the California Supreme Court held that the limitations on recovery for noneconomic damages prescribed by the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act (MICRA) of 1975 apply to certain EMTALA claims. The court stated in a footnote to the case that it was limiting its conclusion to claims under EMTALA for failure to provide necessary stabilizing treatment. The court noted that it did not consider whether the MICRA limits apply to failure to provide an appropriate medical screening examination since the plaintiff’s EMTALA screening claim was dismissed and not an issue before the court.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Discovery of <a id="_idIndexMarker001"></a>Peer Review Records</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">California Evidence Code Section 1157 protects from discovery in civil litigation (such as malpractices cases) the records and proceedings of peer review bodies (including hospital medical staff). As a state rule of evidence, Section 1157 is not always given full effect in federal court. In <span class="Italic">Burrows v. Redbud Community Hospital</span> (187 F.R.D. 606 (1998)), the plaintiff sought to obtain access to peer review records. The California district court declined to apply Section 1157 to the discovery request, based on a prior ruling permitting discovery in a California antitrust case, and a finding that the absolute protection of Section 1157 was inconsistent with the flexibility of federal privilege law.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a>Injunctive Relief</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">A patient may bring an action under EMTALA for injunctive relief against a hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker002"></a>Termination of Medicare Provider Status</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">EMTALA does not authorize private plaintiffs to initiate a civil action to terminate a hospital’s Medicare provider agreement.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"></a>Punitive Damages</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Recovery of damages may include punitive damages if permitted under state law.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"></a>Preemption</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">State and local laws are not preempted, except to the extent that a requirement directly conflicts with EMTALA.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"></a>Standard of Proof<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In January 1999, the U.S. Supreme Court (524 U.S. 249) reversed a Kentucky case in which the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that EMTALA requires showing an improper motive in order for damages to be recovered for an EMTALA violation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In <span class="Italic">Roberts v. Galen of Virginia, Inc.</span>, the patient was admitted to the then Humana Hospital — University of Louisville for injuries resulting from being hit by a truck. Following a two-month stay, the patient was discharged to a nursing facility, where her condition significantly deteriorated. Although the hospital social worker who placed the patient knew that the patient was uninsured, the resident who discharged the patient was unaware of the patient’s financial condition. The patient’s guardian brought an action alleging that the hospital failed to comply with EMTALA by discharging the patient in an unstabilized condition, among other grounds.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The district court ruled in favor of the hospital, finding that the plaintiff had not proven that the patient was medically unstable or that the transfer order was caused by an improper motive. The Sixth Circuit, in affirming the district court decision, held that a patient must demonstrate an improper motive beyond financial considerations in order to maintain a cause of action under EMTALA. As examples of an “improper motive,” the court cited race, sex, politics, occupation, education, personal prejudice, drunkenness and spite.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The <span class="Italic">Roberts</span> case was the first and only EMTALA case to be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court. In a unanimous opinion, the court held that a plaintiff does not have to demonstrate an improper motive by a provider in order to recover damages under EMTALA for failure to provide further examination and treatment to stabilize an emergency medical condition prior to discharge or transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">This decision generally follows the view of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) that motive is not a relevant consideration in determining whether a physician or hospital violated EMTALA. However, an improper motive may increase the amount of civil money penalties assessed against a provider and, in particularly egregious or repeated cases, the possibility of an action to seek exclusion of the provider from the Medicare program.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 ParaOverride-4"><span class="CharOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"></a>Application to Hospital Inpatients</span><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text ParaOverride-2"><span class="CharOverride-4">In </span><span class="Italic CharOverride-4">Roberts</span><span class="CharOverride-4">, the Sixth Circuit (187 F.3d 637) noted in a footnote a prior decision of the same circuit (</span><span class="Italic CharOverride-4">Thornton v. Southwest Detroit Hosp.</span><span class="CharOverride-4">, discussed on </span><a href="EMTALA_Chap14_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor022"><span class="CharOverride-4">page </span><span class="CharOverride-4">14.6</span></a><span class="CharOverride-4">) holding that EMTALA applies to the transfer or discharge of an inpatient. Although the inpatient issue was argued before the court, the decision did not address the issue. At the time that the Supreme Court considered the </span><span class="Italic CharOverride-4">Roberts</span><span class="CharOverride-4"> case, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals had applied EMTALA to inpatients in both </span><span class="Italic CharOverride-4">Roberts</span><span class="CharOverride-4"> and </span><span class="Italic CharOverride-4">Thornton</span><span class="CharOverride-4">; however, the Fourth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals had declined to apply EMTALA to other cases involving inpatients. The Supreme Court declined to address the inpatient question since it was able to decide the case on narrower grounds.</span></p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text ParaOverride-2"><span class="CharOverride-4">Although EMTALA clearly applies to patients presenting to a dedicated emergency department, the statute’s applicability to inpatients is not as obvious. The courts that have addressed the inpatient issue have reached different interpretations of the following two relevant subsections in the statute:</span></p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-4">Subsection (a) of EMTALA specifies that any individual who comes to the emergency department is entitled to a medical screening exam to determine whether an emergency medical condition (EMC) exists.</span></li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-3"><span class="CharOverride-4">Subsection (b) of EMTALA requires the provision of further examination and stabilizing treatment to any emergent patient who comes to a hospital.</span></li></ol></li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text ParaOverride-5"><span class="CharOverride-4">The difference between the references to “emergency department” in subsection (a), and to “hospital” in subsection (b), has been explored by the courts in determining whether they are interdependent or independent.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text ParaOverride-5"><span class="CharOverride-4">By construing each subsection of the statute in conjunction with the other, the Fourth and Ninth Circuits limited the scope of EMTALA to patients who received initial stabilizing care by the hospital. According to these circuits, the statute’s stabilization requirements in subsection (b) apply to patients who have been determined under subsection (a) to have an EMC; therefore, applying the law to hospital inpatients would erroneously extend EMTALA’s scope.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text ParaOverride-5"><span class="CharOverride-4">The First and Sixth Circuits, however, have read these two subsections independently. These circuits have applied the EMTALA obligations to inpatients with an EMC. According to these circuits, EMTALA should apply to all patients suffering from an EMC because the problem of patient dumping is not limited to the emergency room.</span></p>

				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 ParaOverride-7"><span class="CharOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"></a>Decisions Refusing to Apply EMTALA to Inpatients</span><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 ParaOverride-6"><span class="CharOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"></a></span><span class="CharOverride-3"><a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a></span><span class="CharOverride-4">James v. Sunrise Hosp., 86 F.3d 885 (9th Cir. 1996)</span></p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text ParaOverride-2"><span class="CharOverride-4">In James, the plaintiff entered the hospital with acute renal failure. A week later, the hospital discharged her despite her complaints about pain and numbness, a weak pulse and discoloration that had developed since receiving a synthetic graft in her arm when she came to the hospital. The plaintiff’s hand subsequently had to be amputated. The plaintiff sued the hospital under subsection (c) of EMTALA, claiming that she was at the hospital with an EMC and was not stabilized before discharge.</span></p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text ParaOverride-2"><span class="CharOverride-4">The Ninth Circuit held that the case should be dismissed for failure to state a claim under EMTALA, determining that each subsection of EMTALA must be read in conjunction with the </span>others. The court concluded that the transfe<span class="No-break">r/d</span>ischarge obligations in subsection (c) of the EMTALA statute apply only to individuals who first presented to the emergency department (i.e., subsection (a)). Since subsection (c)(iii) of EMTALA requires a qualified professional to certify a transfer when a physician is not present in the emergency department, the court reasoned that the transfer obligations in subsection (c) must apply only to emergency room transfers. “It is impossible to think of a good reason why Congress would condition some subsection (c) transfer provisions on whether a physician ‘is not physically present in the emergency department’ unless it meant to be speaking in subsection (c) about decisions to be made in the emergency room.” Since the plaintiff was not in the emergency room when she was discharged from the hospital, the court refused to apply EMTALA’s transfer obligations to her discharge.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"></a>Bryant v. Adventist Health System West, 289 F.3d 1162 (9th Cir. 2002)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In <span class="Italic">Bryant</span>, the patient presented to the emergency department with a fever and chest pain. The emergency physician examined the patient, ordered tests, and discharged the patient with instructions to return the following day for further diagnosis and treatment. The following day, the hospital called the patient’s family and requested that the patient return to the hospital immediately because of a lung abscess. The patient was seen in the emergency department, admitted as an inpatient, and transferred three days later to a hospital with a higher level of care. Following the death of the patient, the family sued the hospital, claiming a failure by the hospital to detect an EMC and to stabilize that condition as both an emergency patient and an inpatient.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Based on the medical screening and stabilization standard discussed on <a href="EMTALA_Chap14_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor033">page 14.11</a> in connection with the <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> decision, the court upheld the district court’s determination that the hospital did not violate EMTALA on the initial visit to the emergency department. With respect to the alleged failure to provide stabilizing treatment during the inpatient stay, the court, after reviewing the <span class="Italic">Thornton</span> and <span class="Italic">Bryan</span> cases (discussed below), determined that EMTALA does not apply to inpatients unless the patient is admitted as a subterfuge to avoid the EMTALA requirements.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"></a>Bryan v. Rectors &amp; Visitors of the Univ. of Virginia, 95 F.3d 349 (4th Cir. 1996)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In <span class="Italic">Bryan</span>, the patient was admitted to the hospital in emergency respiratory distress. After 12 days of treating the patient, the hospital determined it would not make further efforts to prevent her death, despite the family’s wishes to the contrary. Eight days later, when the patient faced a life-threatening heart attack, the hospital took no action and the patient died. The plaintiff sued the University of Virginia, claiming that the university’s hospital failed to stabilize the patient as required under EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The Fourth Circuit upheld the district court’s dismissal of the plaintiff’s complaint for failure to state a claim under EMTALA. The court explained that “[t]he stabilization requirement was intended to regulate the hospital’s care of the patient only in the immediate aftermath of the act of admitting her for emergency treatment.” The court pointed out that professional standards of care and state medical malpractice laws govern the adequacy of care for a patient once EMTALA’s limited purpose is served, and the patient is beyond initial emergency admission and stabilization. The court added, “everyone agrees EMTALA was not intended to preempt [malpractice law].” Therefore, although it did not address the issue specifically, the court’s reasoning suggests that EMTALA does not impose a continuing obligation to provide stabilizing care to inpatients during the entirety of their stay in the hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"></a>Baxter v. Holy Cross Hosp. et al., 155 F.3d 557 (4th Cir. 1998) (unpublished opinion)<span class="CharOverride-5"><span id="footnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap14_rebuild.html#footnote-001">1</a></span></span> </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In <span class="Italic">Baxter</span>, the patient was admitted for kidney and cardiac problems. Approximately two weeks after admission, the patient’s wife, after consultation with the treating physician, agreed to the termination of the patient’s dialysis due to difficulties in the procedure. The patient remained in the hospital for another week, at which time his wife was advised that the hospital would no longer assume payment for her husband’s care. Although the hospital did not require the patient to leave, his wife consented to his transfer to a nursing facility within a few days of being informed of the hospital’s financial decision. The patient died the day after the transfer. The wife then sued, basing a claim under EMTALA for the hospital’s failure to comply with the statute’s stabilization and transfer requirements.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The Fourth Circuit upheld the dismissal of the plaintiff’s EMTALA claim. The court stated that because the dialysis was discontinued because of the wife’s informed decision, it was impossible for her to claim that the hospital did not meet its duty of stabilization under EMTALA. The court found the case hardly distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Bryan</span> and, accordingly, determined that EMTALA only applied to the initial emergency stabilization. In addition, the court reaffirmed that recovery for allegedly inadequate care beyond the initial emergency treatment should be sought through existing state malpractice laws.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"></a>Decisions Applying EMTALA to Inpatients<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Rather than limit EMTALA’s application to the initial treatment and stabilization of emergency patients, the First and Sixth Circuits have applied EMTALA’s stabilization and transfer requirements to hospital inpatients. These courts have interpreted the subsections of the statute independently. Thus, the stabilization and transfer requirements in subsections (b) and (c) apply to all patients who have come to the hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"></a>Thornton v. Southwest Detroit Hosp., 895 F.2d 1131 (6th Cir. 1990)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In <span class="Italic">Thornton</span>, the patient was transferred to the hospital following a stroke. She entered the hospital through its emergency room, and was admitted to the intensive care unit. After a three-week stay, including 11 days in regular inpatient care, the attending physician recommended that the patient be discharged to a rehabilitation facility. However, the rehabilitation facility refused to accept her because she could not afford the treatment, and the patient instead was released to her sister’s home until she could eventually gain admission to the rehabilitation facility. The patient sued under EMTALA, claiming that the hospital failed to stabilize the EMC that brought her to the hospital. The district court granted summary judgment to the hospital, finding that the hospital had in fact stabilized the patient within the meaning of the law.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The Sixth Circuit upheld the dismissal of the patient’s EMTALA claim since she failed to make a showing that she was not stabilized at the time of discharge. The court specifically noted that its decision was not based on the length of the patient’s stay and treatment in the hospital. At the same time, the court rejected the hospital’s defense that EMTALA did not apply to the patient because she was not discharged from the emergency department.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Instead, the court examined the different wording in subsections (a) and (b) of EMTALA to mean “that once a patient is found to suffer from an emergency medical condition in the emergency room, she cannot be discharged until the condition is stabilized, regardless of whether the patient stays in the emergency room.” As further stated by the court:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">Although emergency care often occurs, and almost invariably begins, in the emergency room, emergency care does not always stop when a patient is wheeled from the emergency room into the main hospital … Emergency care must be given until the patient’s emergency medical condition is stabilized.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Although the <span class="Italic">Thornton</span> opinion is noteworthy in its implication that EMTALA applies to inpatients, the court appears to limit the reach of EMTALA only to those patients who first present in the emergency room.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"></a>Roberts v. Galen of Virginia, Inc., 525 U.S. 249 (1999)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In <span class="Italic">Roberts</span>, a car accident victim was hospitalized for several weeks before the hospital could find a skilled nursing care facility that would agree to take her for long-term care. The patient’s guardian (her aunt) sued the hospital for failure to stabilize her niece prior to transfer. As discussed above, the Sixth Circuit rejected the plaintiff’s EMTALA claim since she failed to show that the transfer was based on an improper motive. It is noteworthy that the appellate court did not address whether EMTALA applied to this case; rather, the court merely cited its <span class="Italic">Thornton</span> decision (discussed above) in a footnote for the proposition that EMTALA applied to an inpatient discharge.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">During oral argument of this case before the U.S. Supreme Court, the federal government advised the court that it would adopt regulations clarifying whether EMTALA applied to inpatients. Accordingly, the court did not provide insight in <span class="Italic">Roberts</span> as to whether EMTALA applies to inpatients, despite the existing conflict over this issue among the lower courts.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"></a>Lopez-Soto v. Hawayek, 175 F.3d 170 (1st Cir. 1999)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In <span class="Italic">Lopez-Soto</span>, the plaintiff was admitted to the maternity ward and gave birth by cesarean section in the operating room to a baby boy who suffered from severe respiratory distress and a pulmonary pneumothorax. The pediatrician determined that the infant required neonatal intensive care available at another hospital; however, the court observed that the pediatrician did not attempt to stabilize the infant or treat him before transfer that evening. The child died the next day.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In reinstating the plaintiff’s claim, the First Circuit explored the relationship of the subsections of EMTALA, and found that they established independent obligations. According to the court, although the screening requirement in subsection (a) refers only to the emergency department, the further treatment and stabilizing treatment requirement in subsection (b) refers to all patients who come to a hospital with an emergency condition. The court stated that the language in subsection (b) “unambiguously imposes certain duties on covered hospitals vis-à-vis any victim of a detected medical emergency, regardless of how that person enters the institution or where within the walls he may be when the hospital identifies the problem.” Therefore, although the infant entered the hospital through the operating room, his emergency condition entitled him to necessary stabilizing treatment under EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">After reviewing the split among the circuit courts (discussed above), the court decided that Congress would not have used particularly different language in subsections (a) and (b) of the statute if it had intended to protect only the emergency department patients identified in subsection (a) from patient dumping. According to the court, “Congress’ decision to change the ‘emergency department’ language rather than repeat it in subsection (b) is potent evidence that Congress preferred to cast a wider net in respect to stabilization.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The court concluded that the hospital’s detection of the infant’s emergency condition triggered the stabilization and transfer requirements under EMTALA. However, the court declined to express a view on the application of EMTALA to patients with continuing unstable conditions (as was the issue in the Fourth Circuit cases above), because the <span class="Italic">Lopez-Soto</span> situation did not call for it. But the court did suggest in a footnote that the issue was a “conundrum” to be dealt with at a later day.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"></a>Postscript</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">All of the foregoing court decisions were rendered prior to the revision of the EMTALA regulations by CMS in 2003. CMS has interpreted the EMTALA statute as not applying to inpatients. The application of EMTALA by CMS to inpatients is discussed further in chapter 2, “When and Where Does EMTALA Begin and End?” Although CMS developed the 2003 regulations based on its view of prevailing judicial trends on the application of EMTALA to inpatients, courts that have previously extended EMTALA to inpatients may not follow the CMS interpretation. As discussed below, the Sixth Circuit decision in <span class="Italic">Moses v. Providence</span> (discussed earlier in this chapter) reaffirmed the view of the Sixth Circuit that the EMTALA obligations apply to inpatients regardless of the contrary CMS regulation. In addition, a District Court in Texas more recently made a distinction in <span class="Italic">Liles v. TH Healthcare LTD</span> (discussed below) between a patient’s “administrative status (i.e., admitted as a bona fide patient)” and a patient’s medical status and whether it was “stabilized,” to apply EMTALA to an inpatient.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"></a>Moses v. Providence Hospital and Medical Ctrs., 561 F.3d 573 (6th Cir. 2009)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">As discussed earlier in this chapter, plaintiff Moses-Irons took her estranged husband Howard to the emergency room due to physical and acute psychiatric distress. Howard was admitted as an inpatient, discharged six days later, and murdered Moses-Irons ten days later. Relying on the 2003 CMS regulation providing that a hospital satisfies its EMTALA obligations by screening and admitting an individual, the hospital argued that it had discharged its EMTALA obligations by providing a screening examination and then admitting her husband to an inpatient care unit for further testing and care. The Sixth Circuit disagreed, stating that the CMS regulation is inconsistent with EMTALA’s language prohibiting a hospital from releasing a patient without first determining that the patient is actually stabilized. In other words, merely admitting her husband as an inpatient and subjecting him to further testing did not discharge the hospital’s EMTALA obligations — the hospital was obligated to actually treat and stabilize her husband before discharge.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"></a>Liles v. TH Healthcare, LTD, et al., No. 2:11-cv-528-JRG (E.D. Tex. Sept. 10, 2012) </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The <span class="Italic">Liles</span> case addressed two separate ED visits by an uninsured patient for EMTALA claims. Plaintiff Liles first came to the emergency room complaining of fever, cough, and shortness of breath and was admitted to the hospital. Over the next few days, Liles contended that while his condition was unstable, various physicians and nurses attempted to transfer him out of the hospital on 18 separate occasions. At one point, he was certified stable for transfer, but at or near the time he was placed in the ambulance he went into cardiac arrest. He was brought back into the hospital’s ICU for approximately one month before being discharged home. The second visit occurred two days after the discharge when Liles was transported to the hospital by ambulance. The hospital refused to admit him for treatment on the grounds that there was no pulmonologist available to evaluate and treat him at the hospital. Liles was eventually transferred to another facility and was diagnosed with a collapsed lung.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Regarding the first visit, the hospital argued that the plaintiff’s EMTALA claims were barred because he had been admitted to a hospital as a bona fide inpatient. The court rejected this argument, citing the statutory language of EMTALA without reference to the regulations and case law from the Fifth Circuit. More specifically, the court held that the plain language of the EMTALA statute indicates that a hospital may not transfer an individual with an emergency medical condition that has not been “stabilized.” The court acknowledged the Fifth Circuit’s holding that a hospital’s responsibility under EMTALA ends when it has stabilized the individual’s medical condition. Therefore, the court found that the application of EMTALA does not depend on the patient’s administrative status (i.e., admitted as an inpatient), but on his or her medical status and whether it was “stabilized.” The court determined that Liles had pled sufficient facts to state a plausible EMTALA claim that his medical condition was not “stabilized” prior to his discharge from his first visit to the hospital, even though he was an inpatient at the time.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">It is important to note that the court did not address the 2003 EMTALA regulations in its decision.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"></a>Application to <a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a>Ambulance Patients</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">As discussed in chapter 2, “When and Where Does EMTALA Begin and End?” the EMTALA regulations provide that a patient in a nonhospital-owned ambulance off hospital property is not considered to have come to the hospital’s emergency department, even if a member of the ambulance staff contacts the hospital and requests transport to the hospital for a patient. In <span class="Italic">Arrington vs. Wong</span>, 237 F.3d 1066 (9th Cir. 2001), ambulance personnel contacted a hospital to which they were transporting a patient in severe respiratory distress. The emergency physician asked the ambulance attendant the name of the patient’s physician, and then told the attendant that it “would be okay” to take the patient to a military hospital. Following the death of the patient, the family brought an action against the hospital (among others) alleging an EMTALA violation for refusing the ambulance. The district court dismissed the action on the grounds that the patient never came to the hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">On appeal, the court interpreted the phrase “comes to the emergency department” to include both the physical arrival on the hospital grounds, as well as the act of traveling to the hospital. The court then reviewed the regulation on ambulances, and noted that a hospital may deny access when it is on diversion. The court interpreted the diversion language as prohibiting a hospital from denying individual access unless it is on diversion. Therefore, the court held that a hospital not on diversion must have a valid treatment-related reason to refuse to accept a patient in a nonhospital-owned ambulance.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In 2008, the First Circuit came to the same conclusion on similar facts. In <span class="Italic">Morales v. Sociedad Espanola De Auxilio Mutuo Y Beneficencia et al.</span>, 524 F.3d 54 (1st Cir. 2008), ambulance personnel contacted the hospital to which they were transporting a patient in pregnancy-related distress. The emergency physician told the ambulance attendant that he was worried that the plaintiff might voluntarily have induced an abortion, that he was very busy and to call back. When the paramedics called again, the emergency physician asked whether the patient had insurance and when he did not receive an affirmative response, hung up the phone. The paramedics took this as a refusal to treat the patient and took her to an alternate facility. The patient and her family brought an action against the hospital alleging an EMTALA violation for refusing the ambulance. The district court granted the hospital summary judgment, but the First Circuit reversed, holding that an individual can “come to” the emergency department for EMTALA purposes without physically arriving on the hospital’s grounds as long as the individual is en route to the hospital and the emergency department has been notified of the individual’s imminent arrival.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Many commentators have been critical of the <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> and <span class="Italic">Morales</span> decisions since the regulation specifically states that a nonhospital-owned ambulance must be on hospital property in order to trigger the EMTALA obligations. Although some CMS personnel have suggested that <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> does not reflect CMS policy, it declined to revise its definition of “comes to the emergency department” in the revised EMTALA regulations. Although it is uncertain whether CMS would confirm an EMTALA violation for a similar case, <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> and <span class="Italic">Morales</span> remain the interpretation of EMTALA in the Ninth Circuit (which includes California) and First Circuit, respectively, for private EMTALA lawsuits against hospitals.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"></a>Application to Urgent Care Centers<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"></a>Friedrich et al. v South County Hospital Healthcare System, et al., 221 F. Supp. 3d 240 (D. Rhode Island 2016)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In <span class="Italic">Friedrich</span>, the patient presented to the hospital’s Urgen<span class="No-break">t/W</span>alk-In Care complaining of severe pain and burning in chest and right arm. She was diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease, given a “GI cocktail,” and discharged with no follow-up ordered. The next day she was found unresponsive at home, transported to the hospital, and pronounced dead. The cause of death was confirmed as atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The issue the court explored was whether the Urgen<span class="No-break">t/W</span>alk-In Care was subject to EMTALA, and therefore required to provide an appropriate medical screening and stabilizing treatment. The decision focused on whether the Urgen<span class="No-break">t/W</span>alk-In Care met the definition of a “dedicated emergency department” of the hospital. Under CMS’ definition (including a department of the hospital that is “held out to the public by name, posted signs, advertising or other means as a place that provides care for emergency medical conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment”), the court noted that the most important criterion is whether the clinic would be perceived by an individual as an appropriate place to go for emergency care. In that case, even though the hospital’s website stated that the clinic was for “non-emergency needs,” and that it did not provide “emergency room level care,” the court found that a person driving by and seeking emergency care would not first check the website; the court also indicated that the signage did not distinguish “urgent” care from “emergency” care. Since patients would believe that the urgen<span class="No-break">t/w</span>alk-in care clinic was held out as an appropriate place to go for emergency care, it was a “dedicated emergency department” under EMTALA.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"></a>Duty to Treat — Inadequate Examination or Refusal or Failure to Treat<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"></a>Inadequate Examination or Stabilization</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The courts have held that a patient may establish a cause of action under EMTALA if a hospital fails to provide an appropriate medical screening examination or stabilize an EMC before transferring a patient to another hospital. A refusal to treat, regardless of whether a transfer has occurred, has been found to constitute an EMTALA violation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"></a>Standard for Medical Screening and Stabilization</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">As discussed in chapter 3, “Medical Screening Examinations,” the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> define an appropriate medical screening examination as an examination sufficient to determine, within reasonable clinical confidence, whether an individual has an EMC. From the beginning of EMTALA, there have been numerous lawsuits against hospitals seeking damages under EMTALA for an inadequate medical screening.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In <span class="Italic">Jackson v. East Bay Hospital</span> (246 F.3d 1248, 1257 (9th Cir. 2001)) the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal addressed the standards for providing the medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment. In <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, the patient presented to the hospital emergency department three times in a four-day period. The initial visit resulted from the referral of the patient who had a psychotic disorder by county mental health for medical clearance; the emergency physician obtained a history, performed a physical examination, ordered tests and determined that there was no medical emergency. Two days later, the patient presented again with a complaint of sore throat, chest pain and dry heaves. The emergency physician saw the patient, ordered EKG and lab tests, diagnosed chest contusions, hypertension and psychosis, prescribed medication and discharged the patient with instructions to return to county mental health the following day. On the following day, the patient was taken to the emergency department after he was found wandering in the road; the emergency physician prescribed additional medication. On request of county mental health, the emergency physician arranged the transfer of the patient to an inpatient psychiatric hospital. Shortly after arrival at the receiving hospital, the patient went into cardiac arrest, and subsequently died following transfer to a third hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In reviewing the three screening examinations performed by the hospital, the court adopted the “comparative test” that had been followed by seven other judicial circuits. A medical screening must be comparable to the screening provided to patients presenting with similar signs and symptoms, unless the examination is so cursory that it is not designed to identify acute or severe symptoms alerting the physician to a possible emergency condition. The court therefore upheld the finding of the district court that the patient received a medical screening on each visit, and that expert witnesses did not believe that this patient was treated differently from other patients presenting with similar signs and symptoms.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The court also adopted the “actual detection” standard that had been followed by five other judicial circuits, and affirmed that a hospital is required to stabilize only those medical conditions that it has detected. The court reaffirmed that EMTALA is not a medical malpractice statute by finding that if the medical screening meets the comparative test, there is no EMTALA liability for failure to identify the patient’s condition or to transfer and discharge the patient based on that assessment.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In an unpublished 2007 decision,<span class="CharOverride-5"><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap14_rebuild.html#footnote-000">2</a></span></span> a federal district court considered when a medical screening examination is so cursory that it is not designed to identify acute or severe symptoms alerting the physician to a possible EMC. In <span class="Italic">Lewellen v. Schneck Medical Center </span><span class="No-break"><span class="Italic">a/k</span></span><span class="Italic">/a Schneck Memorial Hospital et al.</span>, an intoxicated driver was injured when he drove off an interstate highway into a ditch 50 to 100 yards from the road. The paramedics transported the driver to a hospital emergency department due to the driver’s complaint of lower back pain. The patient records indicated that the emergency physician examined the patient, noting a complaint of lower back pain and tenderness of his lumbar spine. The emergency physician also ordered X-rays of the patient’s lumbar and cervical spine.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">A little over an hour after arrival, the emergency physician discharged the patient, despite the patient’s pleading with an emergency department nurse that he was in tremendous pain and wanted to see the physician. The court noted that the last of the X-rays had not been printed at the time of the discharge order.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">According to the court, the emergency physician at some point noted in the medical record that the X-rays did not reveal a fracture and the patient’s lack of cooperation caused the films to be of poor quality. In a quality control process, a hospital radiologist reviewed the films two hours after discharge and noted an ossific density that could be a bone spur, and could not completely exclude a fracture due to the poor quality of the X-rays. The court noted that the radiologist did not notify the emergency physician of his findings, despite hospital protocol.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Lewellen subsequently sued the medical center alleging that the emergency physician failed to provide an appropriate medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment for what turned out to be a burst fracture in his lower back. The court cited the Jackson decision, noting two prongs to the screening test — differential screening and cursory screening. The court then sided with the medical center that Lewellen had not presented evidence that the screening of his medical condition differed from the screening provided to any other patient.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">However, the court then determined that a reasonable jury could conclude that the screening was so cursory that it was not designed to identify acute and severe symptoms. The medical center argued that the emergency physician had performed a neurological examination that appeared normal, and exercised medical judgment in concluding the patient could be safely discharged. The court rejected the medical center’s argument and its request for summary judgment on Lewellen’s EMTALA claim, stating the following:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">But according to the evidence presented by the Plaintiffs, the X-rays ordered by Dr. Resiert were being printed off as Lewellen was being discharged. A jury could conclude that either Dr. Reisert did not even bother to look at them or looked at them so casually that he missed what two other physicians said was obvious: that the X-rays demonstrate that Lewellen had a burst fracture in his spine. If Reisert did not study the X-rays how could his screen be designed to identify acute and severe symptoms? Lewellen’s stay at the hospital was alarmingly brief considering he was in a motor vehicle accident and complaining of severe back pain so bad that he could not stand or sit in a chair correctly. Lewellen still had a bleeding gash in his arm with grass and dirt when he arrived at prison. The court is mindful that EMTALA’s screening requirement means more than an inadvertent failure to follow the regular screening process in a particular case…But this scenario is so grave that a jury could conclude that rather than a negligent deviation from normal practice, the screening requirement was simply not met.” [citations omitted]</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In general, the courts have held that EMTALA is not intended to ensure each emergency room patient a correct diagnosis, but rather to ensure that each patient is accorded the same level of treatment regularly provided to patients in similar medical circumstances. A misdiagnosis alone does not create a cause of action under EMTALA. As stated by one court, “what constitutes an ‘appropriate’ screening is properly determined not by reference to particular outcomes but instead by reference to a hospital’s standard screening procedures.” This has resulted in most courts looking for evidence as to whether a hospital followed its policies and procedures, provided a medical screening examination to determine whether a patient had an EMC, and treated a patient in the same manner as other patients presenting with similar symptoms and conditions. However, the analysis and application of EMTALA in the <span class="Italic">Lewellen</span> decision (even if not a published decision) is a reminder the examination must also meet the “cursory screening” test described in the <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> decision.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"></a>Duty to Treat — Extent of Treatment<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In the <span class="Italic">Matter of Baby “K,”</span> 16 F.3d 590 (4th Cir. 1994), the court held that EMTALA “does not provide an exception for stabilizing treatment physicians may deem medically or ethically inappropriate.” In this case, the hospital sought a declaration from the court that EMTALA does not require continuation of emergency medical treatment (other than warmth, hydration and nutrition) for an anencephalic infant when the physicians and hospital, in accordance with hospital and community standards, determine that treatment would be futile. The court rejected the hospital’s arguments, finding that the hospital was required to provide treatment necessary to prevent the material deterioration of the patient’s EMC (in this case, to provide respiratory support). The court also rejected the hospital’s argument that EMTALA did not require a hospital to provide treatment exceeding the prevailing standard of care, stating that the hospital was obligated to provide stabilizing care for anencephalic infants in the same manner as comatose, cancer or muscular dystrophy patients who may repeatedly present in respiratory distress.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"></a>Failure to Provide Appropriate Transfer</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As described in chapter 5, “Transferring or Discharging an Emergency Patient,” if an individual has an EMC that a hospital does not have the capability to treat, or upon the informed request by the patient, EMTALA obligates a hospital to make an appropriate transfer of an individual to another hospital. There have been several lawsuits against hospitals seeking damages under EMTALA challenging the sufficiency of an informed request for transfer and the physician certification.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As discussed more fully in chapter 5, a 2009 federal district court in <span class="Italic">Guzman v. Memorial Hermann Hospital System</span> (S.D.Tex., No. H-07-3973, June 16, 2009), addressed a patient’s informed request for transfer. The court stated that a hospital cannot meet its EMTALA obligation to obtain patient consent to transfer (as opposed to physician certification) by merely having a patient or proxy sign a form. Rather, EMTALA requires that the hospital inform the patient about the hospital’s obligations to provide examination and stabilizing treatment as well as the risks and benefits of transfer before initiating the request and having the patient or proxy sign the form.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In a separate 2009 decision, a District Court in Iowa reviewed the sufficiency of the physician certification, finding a lack of evidence that the physician adequately deliberated and weighed the medical risks and benefits of a transfer. The court also found that the physician gave improper consideration to significant factors in certifying the transfer (<span class="Italic">Heimlicher v. Steele </span>(615 F.Supp.2d 884, 2009)). The analysis of the <span class="Italic">Heimlicher</span> court is discussed in chapter 3, “Medical Screening Examinations.”</p>
