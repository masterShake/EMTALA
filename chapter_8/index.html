			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">A hospital must take all reasonable steps to secure the informed refusal of a patient (or a person acting on the patient’s behalf). The refusal must be in writing; <a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a>document that the patient was informed of the benefits of treatment or transfer, and state the reasons for the patient’s refusal. As noted by CMS, a person acting on the patient’s behalf cannot refuse examination, treatment or a transfer unless the patient is incapable of making an informed decision for himself or herself. The patient’s medical record must contain a description of the proposed examination, treatment or transfer that was offered by the hospital but refused by the patient. If the individual refuses to sign an informed refusal, the hospital should document the steps taken to secure a signed refusal. CHA has developed CHA Form 9-6, “Patient Refusal of Further Medical Treatment,” which can be used for this purpose and is included in Appendix P.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In addition to the EMTALA requirements, hospitals should review CHA’s <span class="Italic">Consent Manual</span> for additional guidance and documentation for situations involving refusal of medical care.

				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>What should the hospital do if a patient withdraws his or her request for examination or leaves the hospital before receiving a medical screening?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">One of the most common areas of EMTALA enforcement is the patient who presents for treatment to a dedicated emergency department, but then leaves the hospital prior to receiving a medical screening examination (and sometimes, even before triage). In some cases, the patient tells a nurse or clerk that he or she feels better, and leaves the hospital. In other cases, the patient tells a nurse or clerk that he or she does not want to wait for  the medical screening examination or that he or she will go elsewhere (to a primary care physician or another facility). In other cases, the patient simply elopes and is not in the waiting room when called for his or her medical screening examination.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In all of these cases, the patient has presented for emergency services, but has not received a medical screening examination. Without a medical examination, the patient cannot be said to be leaving against medical advice (AMA), since the hospital does not have sufficient medical information to inform the patient of the risks of leaving the hospital. However, the triage report often documents the presenting complaint, vital signs and other preliminary findings that provide regulators with information sufficient to speculate as to whether the patient had a potential emergency medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">These types of cases have been the focus of EMTALA enforcement actions. Hospitals have been cited by CMS and subject to potential OIG sanctions for failing to provide a medical screening examination to a person presenting to the emergency department for emergency services. The lack of a medical screening examination an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r inadequate documentation of the patient’s reasons for leaving puts the hospital at a severe disadvantage when later explaining the circumstances for the patient’s departure and defending the speculation of the regulators as to the potential condition of the patient.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In the preamble to the Special Advisory Bulletin (see Appendix H), CMS and the OIG advise that hospitals should be very concerned about patients leaving without being screened, especially if due to waiting times:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-5">Since every patient who presents seeking emergency services is entitled to  a medical screening examination, a hospital could violate the patient anti- dumping statute if it routinely keeps patients waiting so long that they leave without being seen, particularly if the hospital does not attempt to determine and document why individual patients are leaving, and reiterate to them that the hospital is prepared to provide a medical screening if they stay.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">This advice reinforces the need for hospitals to monitor waiting times for emergency services and the rate of patient departures before the provision of the medical screening examination.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip _idGenParaOverride-6"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> Hospitals should develop quality management measures to determine the reasons for patient departures, and implement actions as appropriate to reduce unacceptable rates of patient elopement. In addition, patient registration, reception and other emergency staff should receive periodic in-service reminders of the need to document 1) early patient departures and elopements, and 2) communication to patients offering the medical screening and encouraging patients to stay for their examination. For example, some hospitals have developed information sheets to hand to patients at triage informing them of the medical screening, encouraging patients to remain for their examination by the emergency physician, and urging them to inform the triage nurse or other emergency staff if they decide to leave the dedicated emergency department or other hospital location before they receive their medical screening.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>Patient Elopes or Leaves Without Notice</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">If a patient elopes or leaves the hospital without advising personnel in the dedicated emergency department or other location as to his or her reasons for leaving, the hospital, to the best of its ability, should document the circumstances of the patient’s departure. It is recommended that hospital personnel call the patient’s name in the waiting area several times, and note the times in the medical record. If the patient does not respond, the medical record should include the time when hospital staff became aware of the departure and any other pertinent information related to the patient and his or her medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Some hospitals have initiated patient follow-up call programs where they telephone eloped patients within a few days after their emergency visits to inquire as to the reasons for leaving the hospital and their present medical status. This information has been used effectively by  a hospital in responding to allegations of the quality improvement organization (QIO) that the hospital failed to provide medical screening examinations to a number of patients who allegedly may have had emergency medical conditions (based on triage data). Using the information derived from the follow-up calls, the hospital was able to demonstrate that the patients left the hospital for valid reasons (such as the patient felt better) and were in good health.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Patient Gives Reason for Leaving</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">If a patient advises the hospital that he or she is leaving prior to the medical screening, the hospital should make every effort to offer the patient the examination, encourage the patient to wait and, if unsuccessful, obtain from the patient the reasons for leaving the hospital. Some hospitals have developed forms for refusal of a medical screening examination. Regardless of whether the patient signs a form, the hospital should document the patient’s reasons for leaving. The documentation should be sufficiently detailed to reply to a subsequent complaint from the patient or a licensing surveyor that the hospital refused or discouraged the patient from receiving a medical screening examination. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> state that the medical record should reflect that the hospital offered to provide screening and treatment before the patient’s refusal.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a>Patient Departs for Financial Reasons</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">One of the more difficult situations is handling the patient who leaves the hospital before the medical screening examination due to financial reasons. Often, a patient will ask hospital personnel how much his or her emergency services will cost or whether it accepts the patient’s managed care plan, and then leave the hospital without receiving emergency services. CMS has repeatedly cautioned hospitals that discussing payment obligations when a patient is deciding on whether to accept or refuse treatment will be closely scrutinized to determine whether the hospital discouraged the patient from seeking further treatment. CMS has warned that hospitals “may not attempt to coerce individuals into making judgments against their interest by informing them that they will have to pay for their care if they remain but that their care will be free or at lower cost if they transfer to another hospital.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip _idGenParaOverride-6"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> It is recommended that hospitals have clear guidelines for staff to handle these situations, and ensure, through in-service education and policies, that hospitals offer to provide emergency services, encourage the patient to stay and document the circumstances of and reasons for the patient’s decision to decline further care.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a>Documentation of Risks and Benefits</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Under the EMTALA regulations, a hospital must inform a patient of the risks and benefits of refusing further examination and treatment. The regulation applies this obligation to a refusal of the further examination and treatment rendered after a patient has received a medical screening examination.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">If the patient withdraws his or her request for a medical screening before the examination has been performed, the hospital may not have sufficient medical information to describe the risks and benefits to the individual if he or she leaves the hospital. This is consistent with a statement by CMS and OIG in the Special Advisory Bulletin that prior to performing the medical screening examination, a hospital is “ill-informed” to advise a health plan of the patient’s condition. The rationale for this position is that prior to receiving a medical screening, the patient has not been examined by a qualified professional who has obtained the requisite clinical knowledge to advise a health plan of the patient’s medical status. If a hospital is “ill-informed” to advise a managed care plan of a patient’s condition, then it should be equally “ill-informed” to advise the patient of the risks and benefits of withdrawing a request for a medical screening examination.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">However, this interpretation of EMTALA is not necessarily held by CMS and the OIG. A number of hospitals have been cited by these agencies for their failure to inform a patient withdrawing a request for the medical screening of the risks and benefits of leaving the hospital prior to his or her examination. Regardless of what action a hospital takes with respect to a patient who withdraws his or her request for the medical screening prior to the performance of the examination, hospitals should take (and document) every step taken to offer and encourage the patient to remain for his or her medical screening examination.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-2"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>&#9;References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-7">42 C.F.R.
