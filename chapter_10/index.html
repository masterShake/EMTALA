These signs must state the rights of individuals under EMTALA to examination and treatment for emergency medical conditions and women in labor, and whether the hospital participates in the Medicaid program. Posting of signs is not required in off-campus departments that are not dedicated emergency departments.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor003"></a>Requirements<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has listed the following requirements for EMTALA signage <span class="Italic">(see extract from the preamble to the 1994 EMTALA regulations at the end of this chapter)</span>:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Signs must specify the rights of unstable individuals with emergency conditions and women in labor who come to the dedicated emergency department for health care services;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Signs must indicate whether the facility participates in the Medicaid program;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">The wording of the signs must be clear and in simple terms understandable by the population served;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Signs must be printed in English and other major languages that are common to the population of the hospital service area;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">The letters within the signs must be clearly readable at a distance of at least 20 feet, or from the expected vantage point of dedicated emergency department patrons; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Signage must be posted in a place or places likely to be noticed by all individuals entering the dedicated emergency department, as well as those individuals waiting for examination and treatment (e.g., entrance, admitting area, waiting room, treatment area).</li></ol></li>

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Some states have adopted additional requirements for signage relating to emergency care. For example, California law requires that signs list the name, address and telephone number of the district office of the California Department of Public Health, Licensing and Certification Division.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In the preamble to the final 1994 EMTALA regulations, CMS suggested the following model language for the EMTALA signage <span class="Italic">(see extract from 1994 EMTALA regulations on </span><a href="EMTALA_Chap10_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor004"><span class="Italic">page </span><span class="Italic">10.3</span></a><span class="Italic">)</span>:</p>

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text ParaOverride-5">Hospitals are permitted to add other information to the signs. However, signs or other information that are viewed by CMS as discouraging patients from using the dedicated emergency department may result in an EMTALA violation.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">California law also requires all hospitals providing licensed perinatal services to post a written notice in the obstetrical admitting area stating that the hospital does not maintain practices that result in different standards of obstetrical care based upon a patient’s source of payment or ability to pay for medical services. The notice must be posted in the predominant language or languages spoken in the service area of the hospital. CHA has adopted model signage for complying with the law; the model signage is set forth in Appendix P under “Obstetrical Care Notice.”</p>

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text ParaOverride-3">Section 6018(a)(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA ‘89), effective July 1, 1990, requires hospitals and rural primary care hospitals with emergency departments to post signs which specify the rights (under section  1867 of the Social Security Act) of women in labor and individuals with emergency medical conditions to examination and treatment.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text ParaOverride-3">To comply with these requirements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Bullet-List ParaOverride-6">At a minimum, the sign must specify the rights of unstable individuals with emergency conditions and women in labor who come to the emergency department for health care services;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Bullet-List ParaOverride-6">It must indicate whether the facility participates in the Medicaid program;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Bullet-List ParaOverride-6">The wording of the sign must be clear and in simple terms understandable by the population serviced.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Bullet-List ParaOverride-6">Print the signs in English and other major languages that are common to the population of the area serviced;</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Bullet-List ParaOverride-6">The letters within the signs must be clearly readable at a distance of at least 20 feet or the expected vantage point of the emergency department patrons; and</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Bullet-List ParaOverride-6">Post signs in a place or places likely to be noticed by all individuals entering the emergency department, as well as those individuals waiting for examina- tion and treatment (e.g., entrance, admitting area, waiting room, treatment area).</li>

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) have developed a poster about pain management and opioids called “Safer, More Effective Pain Management.” In addition, CDC and the American Hospital Association (AHA) have developed a poster called “Prescription Opioids: What You Need to Know.” Hospitals and other health care providers may post these signs in areas that patients are likely to see them, including emergency department waiting areas. CMS has confirmed that posting these signs will not be considered an EMTALA violation (even if some patients may read them and be discouraged from accessing services).
