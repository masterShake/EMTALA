The receiving hospital obligation applies to all hospitals participating in Medicare, regardless of whether they provide emergency services. The EMTALA statute captions the accepting hospital obligation with the term “nondiscrimination,” implying that receiving hospitals do not have the discretion to refuse a transfer request for an emergency patient with an unstabilized EMC except in specific circumstances <span class="Italic">(see </span><a href="EMTALA_Chap7_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor007"><span class="Italic">D.&#160;“When can a hospital refuse to accept a transfer?,” page&#160;</span><span class="Italic">7.4</span></a><span class="Italic">)</span>.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">CMS has suggested that any Medicare participating hospital may be considered to have specialized capabilities or facilities if it has the capability and capacity to provide a service that the transferring hospital does not have the capability to perform. Under this view of EMTALA, virtually every hospital must consider itself a receiving hospital and accept appropriate transfers of emergency patients with unstabilized EMCs from other hospitals that do not have the capacity or capability to provide stabilizing treatment. The expansive nature of the accepting hospital obligation was reaffirmed by CMS in 2006 when it amended the EMTALA regulations to clarify that any hospital with specialized capabilities must accept an appropriate transfer, even if the hospital does not operate a dedicated emergency department.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Enforcement of EMTALA by CMS and by patients in litigation cases against receiving hospitals that refuse the acceptance of an appropriate transfer has become very common. In the <span class="Italic">St. Anthony Hospital</span> case <span class="Italic">(see </span><a href="EMTALA_Chap7_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor005"><span class="Italic">page </span><span class="Italic">7.2</span></a><span class="Italic">)</span>, a federal appeals court upheld the imposition of OIG sanctions against a hospital for failure to accept an emergency patient with an unstabilized EMC. A growing number of hospitals have been cited for refusal to accept a transfer (including some cases involving individuals whose EMCs were arguably stabilized prior to transfer). Therefore, hospitals need effective policies, periodic in-service training and effective oversight of personnel and physicians who respond to requests to accept emergency patient transfers.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="All-Caps-Bold">Note:</span> This chapter is limited to legal obligations with respect to accepting patient transfers under EMTALA. Hospitals should consider ethical, philosophical and industry standards, as well as managed care obligations and transfer agreements with other hospitals, in making decisions on transfers, whether or not implicated by EMTALA or other laws.</p></li>

For EMTALA purposes, a patient who has been admitted to the transferring hospital, but is boarded in the emergency department pending the assignment to an available bed is considered an inpatient;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">The individual has been determined by the treating physician (or other qualified professional) at the transferring hospital to have an EMC;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">The EMC has not been stabilized in the clinical judgment of the treating physician or qualified professional;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">The treating physician has determined that the hospital does not have the present capacity and/or capability to provide further examination or treatment that is required to stabilize the individual’s EMC, or the individual has made an informed request for the transfer;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">The transferring hospital has contacted a receiving hospital seeking to arrange the transfer of the individual who has an EMC that is not stabilized. The request may be made to any hospital that may be able to provide treatment necessary to stabilize the EMC. Specifically, there is no requirement that the transferring hospital must contact the closest available hospital or a facility that is aligned with the patient’s insurance or economic status, such as a county hospital; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">The receiving hospital has the specialized services (i.e., the higher level of care) required by the individual, and the capacity and the capability to provide those services.</li></ol></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>What are the lessons of the <span class="CharOverride-3">St. Anthony Hospital</span> case with respect to accepting patient transfers?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In <span class="Italic">St. Anthony Hospital v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 309 F.3d 680 (10th Cir. 2002), the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals reviewed an appeal by an Oklahoma hospital of an U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administrative decision to impose civil money penalties for the hospital’s refusal to accept an appropriate transfer of an emergency patient. The lessons from the case are instructive as to the views of the courts with respect to the receiving hospital obligation and the handling of requests to accept patient transfers.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2"> </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In the case, the patient was a 65-year old victim of an automobile accident who suffered a neurological injury. Although the transferring hospital arranged for a transfer to a university medical center, the ambulance returned to the transferring facility due to the patient’s deterioration. Upon re-examination, the emergency physician determined that the patient had an injury to his abdominal aorta, and required immediate surgery that could not be performed at the hospital. The physician contacted an air-ambulance service, but could not transfer the patient to the university medical center since it had two pending emergency surgeries. The physician then contacted the emergency physician at another hospital, who referred the call to the on-call thoracic and vascular surgeon. The on-call surgeon declined to accept the case, and the transferring hospital finally located a third hospital that accepted the patient.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Following CMS review, the OIG proposed to impose monetary sanctions for the refusal by the second hospital to accept the transfer. When the parties failed to settle the case, the OIG initiated an administrative proceeding. The administrative law judge (ALJ) confirmed the EMTALA violation and imposed a $25,000 sanction. On appeal, the Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) affirmed the ALJ’s decision, and, on a cross-appeal by the OIG, increased the sanction to $35,000.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The defendant hospital then petitioned the 10th Circuit Court of Appeal to overturn the decision of DAB, citing numerous procedural and substantive objections to the DAB’s actions, and challenging the findings regarding the patient’s instability and the hospital’s refusal of the transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The following are among the interpretations and conclusions made by the court:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">“Stability,” as used in the medical profession, does not carry the same meaning as “stabilized” under EMTALA.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">A request made by an emergency physician to a receiving hospital to accept a transfer is not required to be precise, as long as the statement generally indicates the desire to arrange a transfer.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">Although the receiving hospital argued that its on-call surgeon was not authorized to refuse a transfer, it conceded that its emergency physician had authority to accept or refuse a transfer. Therefore, the hospital was liable when the emergency physician communicated the refusal of the on-call surgeon to accept the patient.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">The transferring physician’s judgment will be accorded weight in determining the stability of the patient:<p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-6">We note that as a practical matter, however, any hospital with specialized capabilities or facilities that refuses a request to transfer an unstabilized patient risks violating [EMTALA] to the extent that it chooses to second-guess the medical judgment of the transferring hospital.</p></li></ol></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a>Can a receiving hospital ask why a patient is being transferred?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In addition to determining the patient’s condition and clinical needs, an accepting hospital should be able to inquire as to the medical reason(s) for the transfer. As discussed above, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> permit a hospital to decline a “lateral transfer.” If the receiving hospital believes that the transferring hospital is able to provide the level of service required for stabilizing the patient’s EMC, the receiving hospital should be able to inquire as to the medical reason(s) for the transfer in order to determine whether it is a lateral transfer, including asking about the beds, services, equipment or specialty physician coverage that may be available.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">However, inquiries as to the capability of the sending hospital may be viewed as delaying or discouraging a necessary transfer, or as second-guessing the decision of the sending physician. If a transferring hospital indicates that it lacks the present capability or capacity to provide the stabilizing treatment required for the patient, the receiving hospital should accept the transfer (if it has the capacity and capability to do so) and make appropriate inquiries after the patient has arrived at the receiving facility about the capacity and capability of the transferring hospital at the time of transfer.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>When can a hospital refuse to accept a transfer?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">A receiving hospital may refuse to accept a transfer of an emergency patient with an EMC in five circumstances:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">The patient is an inpatient at the transferring hospital;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">The transferring hospital is not located in the United States (which, for EMTALA purposes, includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands);</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">The patient’s EMC is stabilized (in other words, EMTALA does not apply to the transfer), as determined by the transferring physician. If a receiving hospital is asked to accept the transfer of an emergency patient whose condition is reported by the sending physician to be stabilized, but needs post-stabilization services at a facility providing a higher level of care, the receiving hospital should confirm with the transferring physician, and document, that the patient’s condition is in fact stabilized. The hospital may then advise the transferring hospital that it is willing to admit and treat the patient subject to financial or insurance clearance, including obtaining prior authorization for the post-stabilization services. In addition, the hospital may be required to accept the patient if it has a legal or contractual obligation to do so, independent of its EMTALA obligations;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">The receiving hospital does not have the present capacity or capability to provide the emergency medical services required for the patient. If the receiving hospital’s specialized services are at capacity or otherwise unavailable, CMS will examine whether the receiving hospital has historically created additional capacity by opening additional beds, moving patients, calling in staff, etc., in order to admit patients in similar circumstances; or</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-4">The transferring hospital has the present capacity and capability to provide the emergency medical services required for the patient (i.e., the transferring hospital provides the same level of service as the receiving hospital at the time of the transfer). The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> state that EMTALA permits a receiving hospital to refuse a “lateral transfer” in some instances (although state law or contractual obligations may require the hospital to accept the patient). However, if a transferring hospital is operating beyond its capacity (e.g., there are no ICU beds available) or has an equipment malfunction, then a receiving hospital may be obligated to accept a transfer because the transferring hospital, at the time of the transfer, does not have an equivalent level of care as the receiving hospital.</li></ol></li></ol></li>

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The obligations of hospitals under California law to accept transfers in certain situations are discussed at the end of this chapter.</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>Are there different standards for acceptance of a transfer of a patient who has a psychiatric emergency medical condition?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">As discussed in chapter 6, there is no distinction under the EMTALA rules between the transfer of an individual with a medical EMC or an individual with a psychiatric EMC. Some California counties have published guidance that attempts to limit the transfer of involuntary psychiatric patients to specified facilities; for example, guidance published in 2012 and again in 2014 by a California county stated that “[s]ending patients on an involuntary hold to hospitals not designated by [<span class="CharOverride-4"> &#9;&#9;&#9;</span>] County is illegal.” However, the EMTALA regulations do not prohibit a transferring hospital from arranging an appropriate transfer of an individual with an unstabilized EMC, whether medical or psychiatric, to <span class="Bold">any</span> facility that has the capacity and capability to stabilize the individual’s EMC. This expressly permits a hospital to transfer an emergency department patient with an unstabilized psychiatric condition to any hospital within or outside of the county in which the sending hospital is located, as well as across state lines if necessary to find a facility that has the capacity and capability to stabilize the emergency psychiatric condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Conversely, a receiving hospital cannot refuse an appropriate transfer from an emergency department of an individual with an EMC, whether medical or psychiatric, if it has the capacity and capability to stabilize the individual’s EMC. In some cases, a county behavioral health department or mental health plan may try to limit the number of admissions of involuntary patients at a contracting facility. However, if the contracting facility has the capability and capacity to stabilize a psychiatric patient’s condition, it cannot decline the transfer due to the limitations imposed by the county or health plan. Similarly, it cannot refuse to accept EMTALA patients with unstabilized psychiatric conditions who are transferred across county lines.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Can a hospital refuse a transfer if there are hospitals closer to the transferring hospital that can provide the required services?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">EMTALA does not permit a receiving hospital to refuse an emergency transfer because another receiving hospital is closer to the transferring hospital and can provide the higher level of care required for the patient.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Although EMTALA requires a receiving hospital to accept the appropriate transfer of an emergency patient with an unstabilized EMC, it does not require the transferring hospital to select the closest available hospital that provides the higher level of care required by the patient. Rather, EMTALA assumes that the transferring physician will exercise good faith professional judgment in selecting the receiving hospital. This should not preclude a receiving hospital at a lengthy distance from the transferring hospital to inquire of the transferring hospital as to the availability of a closer hospital, although it should be clearly communicated to the transferring hospital that the inquiry is made for informational purposes to understand the circumstances of the transfer, and not as a condition or barrier to acceptance of the transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">A hospital may also not refuse a transfer because the patient is from out of state, even if there is another receiving hospital closer to the transferring hospital. In an OIG settlement reported in the OIG Semiannual Report to Congress for Oct. 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016, the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) allegedly failed to accept the appropriate transfer of a patient who needed specialized capabilities of the hospital to stabilize her emergency medical condition. UMMC refused the transfer request because of a UMMC policy that it would not accept the transfer of Louisiana residents. The OIG reported that UMMC entered into a $50,000 settlement agreement to resolve the alleged EMTALA violation.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a>Can a hospital place conditions on accepting a transfer?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In a 2007 CMS memorandum (S&amp;C 07-20) subsequently incorporated into tag. no. A-241<span class="No-break">1/C</span>-2411of the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> (included in Appendix C), CMS declared that placing conditions on the acceptance of transfers is disfavored by CMS, and will likely subject the receiving hospital to an EMTALA violation. In the memorandum, CMS reported that the EMTALA Technical Advisory Group had received testimony regarding situations where a hospital had refused to accept a transfer unless the transferring hospital used an air medical service owned by the receiving hospital for the transfer. As stated in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-7">A hospital with specialized capabilities or facilities that has the necessary capacity to treat an individual with an emergency medical condition may not condition or attempt to condition its acceptance of an appropriate transfer of an individual protected under EMTALA on the use of a particular mode of transport or transport service.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In addition, CMS has cautioned hospitals against patient delays or disparate treatment of patients based on financial or insurance status:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-7">If a managed care member comes to a hospital that offers emergency services, the hospital must provide the services required under the EMTALA statute without regard for the individual’s insurance status or any prior authorization requirement of such insurance. This requirement applies equally to both referring and receiving (recipient) hospitals. Therefore, it may be a violation if the receiving hospital delays acceptance of an individual with an unstabilized EMC pending receipt or verification of financial information…</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">For instance, if there is evidence that the receiving hospital unreasonably delayed the treatment of certain individuals and expedited the treatment of other individuals, based on their ability to pay for the services or some other form of discrimination, then the receiving hospital may be in violation of EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Hospitals have been sanctioned under EMTALA, including receiving fines, for requesting pre-admission deposits or limiting acceptance of transfers to patients residing in the same county as the receiving hospital. A request from the receiving hospital at the time of transfer for a payment guarantee will likely be considered a possible violation of EMTALA. In addition, requests to the transferring hospital to perform additional tests or arrange for an on-call consultation may constitute a violation if the transferring physician believes that there is an immediate need for the transfer or the request of the receiving facility will delay an appropriate transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Some receiving hospitals have attempted to limit their acceptance of a patient with an EMC to the provision of the specialized services that necessitated the transfer. After the specialized services have been rendered and the patient is stable, the receiving hospital plans to return the patient to the transferring hospital for further inpatient care if safe to do so. These arrangements are often contained in transfer agreements between two hospitals that are signed outside the immediacy of accepting a transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">A “take-back” agreement should not be raised at the time of a request to accept a transfer. In view of the position taken by CMS in the memorandum, imposing a “take-back” condition at the time of a transfer request (in the absence of a prior arrangement in a transfer agreement between the two hospitals) may place the receiving hospital in jeopardy of an EMTALA violation if the transferring hospital rejects the condition and reports the receiving hospital for refusing the transfer in the absence of accepting the “take-back” condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip _idGenParaOverride-8"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> It is strongly recommended that conditions for accepting a transfer not be made on an ad hoc basis at the time of a requested transfer because the discussions could delay an appropriate transfer of an emergency patient. Instead, arrangements should be handled in advance through transfer agreements between hospitals.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a>What is the responsibility of an <a id="_idIndexMarker002"></a>on-call physician to accept an emergency patient transfer?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">As described above, if a hospital requests the transfer of an emergency patient with an unstabilized EMC so that the patient can access a higher level of care, the receiving facility is obligated to accept the transfer unless it does not have the capacity to treat the patient. Under EMTALA, the receiving hospital must utilize its resources, including its medical staff, to evaluate and stabilize the patient.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">By extension, a physician on call to the receiving hospital has the same obligation as the hospital to accept a patient with an unstabilized EMC and to come to the hospital to treat the patient. If an on-call physician is available to accept the transfer of an unstabilized emergency patient, the receiving hospital has the capability and capacity to treat the patient and the transfer is otherwise appropriate under the circumstances. A refusal by the on-call physician to accept the patient may result in an EMTALA violation by the hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">As discussed above, the on-call physician in the <span class="Italic">St. Anthony Hospital</span> case refused to accept a patient transfer. Although the receiving hospital argued that its on-call surgeon was not authorized to refuse a transfer, it conceded that its emergency physician had authority to accept or refuse a transfer. Therefore, the hospital was liable for an EMTALA violation when the emergency physician communicated the refusal of the on-call surgeon to accept the patient. <span class="Italic">(See chapter 11, “Physician On-Call Responsibilities,” for additional guidance about on-call physician responsibilities.)</span></p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip _idGenParaOverride-8"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> Many hospitals have received an EMTALA sanction where, without their knowledge, an on-call physician refuses to accept an appropriate transfer. As discussed under<span class="CharOverride-5"> </span><a href="EMTALA_Chap7_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor018"><span class="CharOverride-5">III.&#160;“Communication With Transferring Hospitals,” page&#160;</span><span class="CharOverride-5">7.10</span></a><span class="CharOverride-5">, the hospital should implem</span>ent measures to manage the transfer acceptance process, including communications between transferring facilities and the receiving hospital’s on-call physicians. Hospitals should advise their coverage physicians that if they receive a call from a transferring hospital regarding a transfer, they should refer the transferring hospital to a designated person or office at the receiving hospital to confirm its capability and capacity to accept the patient.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"></a>Must a hospital accept an emergency patient whose condition is reported as “stable”?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">As noted in the <span class="Italic">St. Anthony Hospital</span> decision, “stability” as used in the medical profession does not carry the same meaning as “stabilized” under EMTALA. In the 2004 <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, CMS deleted the concept of “stable for transfer,” stating instead that an EMC must be resolved before the condition is considered to be stabilized. As discussed in chapter 5, “Transferring or Discharging an Emergency Patient,” and set forth in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> in Appendix C, the transfer of a patient with an unresolved EMC who is nonetheless clinically stable for transfer requires compliance with the EMTALA standards for an appropriate transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In communications between sending and receiving hospitals, facility personnel need to be clear as to whether the patient has an emergency medical condition that is “unstabilized.” CMS has warned that the use of the word “stable” may be misinterpreted as suggesting that the emergency condition is “stabilized.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The concerns about using “stable” are illustrated in a 2013 guidance (Appendix X) issued by CMS. In the letter, CMS cautioned hospitals that “the statutory definition of an individual’s EMC being ‘stabilized’ does not necessarily equate to an individual being clinically stable.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-7">The similarity of the terms “clinically stable” and “stabilized” appears to cause confusion among hospitals, practitioners and other hospital staff. It is not uncommon for practitioners to find that an individual has become “clinically stable,” often understood to mean the normalization of the individual’s vital signs, and then conclude that the hospital’s EMTALA obligation has ended. However, if the EMC has not been stabilized, as that term is defined ... [by the EMTALA regulations], EMTALA continues to apply. For example, a patient diagnosed with appendicitis might have relatively normal vital signs, but is still in need of surgery, and therefore continues to have an EMC that has not been stabilized.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-7">Furthermore, many practitioners and some third-party payors seem to assume that if an individual can withstand the risk of a transfer, then that means the individual has been stabilized and the hospital’s EMTALA obligation has ended. This also is not necessarily the case. This mistaken assumption can be reflected in the commonly used term “stable for transfer.” “Stable for transfer” is not a term used in EMTALA, and it is not necessarily equivalent to the term “stabilized,” as defined for EMTALA purposes. Use of this term can, therefore, be very misleading. [CMS Survey and Certification Memo No. 14-06 (Dec. 13, 2013)]</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">Because CMS considers the transfer of a patient with an unresolved EMC to implicate the EMTALA transfer requirements, it is likely that the receiving hospital has a corresponding obligation to accept the patient who requires a higher level of care than the transferring facility can provide. However, a receiving hospital does not have an EMTALA obligation to accept the transfer of an emergency patient who is stabilized (i.e., the emergency is resolved) unless the hospital has an independent legal or contractual obligation to accept the transfer.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"></a>Must a hospital accept the transfer of an emergency patient if the hospital does not meet <a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a>nurse staffing standards?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The nurse staffing standards in California place a hospital in a Catch-22 situation when it has available beds but will not meet the staffing ratios if it accepts an emergency patient transfer. Does a hospital have “capacity” within the meaning of EMTALA to accept a critically ill individual with an unresolved EMC if the admitting unit will not meet the staffing ratios; or, should (or must) the hospital refuse to accept the transfer?</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">As discussed in chapter 5, “Transferring or Discharging an Emergency Patient,” the California Department of Public Health has not provided advice on compliance with the nurse staffing ratios and accepting emergency patient transfers. In the absence of guidance, the hospital must decide whether to accept the transfer of the patient (and possibly violate the nurse staffing ratios) or refuse the transfer on the basis of staffing constraints.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">If the hospital accepts and admits the patient when it is out of compliance with staffing ratios, a surveyor may later cite the hospital under state law, which may subject the facility to fines or other sanctions under state and federal laws, as well as litigation by the patient if there is an adverse outcome. If the hospital declines the transfer, a surveyor may later review the admission patterns at the time of the transfer (were other patients admitted or transferred?) and the historical practices of the hospital in admitting or transferring patients in similar situations; the survey could result in an EMTALA violation, as well as potential litigation if there is an adverse outcome. Hospitals are therefore encouraged to discuss this subject with their legal counsel.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"></a>How does a hospital handle <a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a>prior authorization by managed care plans for acceptance and admission of plan enrollees?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">In the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, CMS warns receiving hospitals that they may not delay acceptance of an emergency patient transfer pending verification of financial information. Therefore, if a receiving hospital is asked to accept the transfer of a health plan enrollee who has an unstabilized EMC and needs a higher level of care, the hospital should accept the patient if it has the capacity and capability to provide the services. The hospital should confirm the patient’s condition with the transferring hospital or physician, and ensure that it obtains a copy of the physician’s certification for the transfer. Following the admission of the patient at the receiving hospital, the hospital should seek authorization for services that will be required for the patient after he or she is stabilized.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">If a receiving hospital is asked to accept the transfer of a health plan emergency patient whose condition is stabilized (i.e., the EMC is resolved), but needs post-stabilization services at a facility providing a higher level of care, the receiving hospital should confirm with the transferring hospital or physician that the patient’s condition is stabilized. The hospital may then advise the transferring hospital that it is willing to admit and treat the patient subject to obtaining prior authorization for the post-stabilization services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">As discussed in chapter 4, “Financial Considerations — EMTALA and Managed Care,” the transferring hospital may have an obligation to contact the health plan prior to sending an enrollee to a non-contract hospital for post-stabilization services. The receiving hospital should inform the transferring hospital that, if the patient’s condition becomes unstable while it is seeking prior authorization, the transferring hospital should immediately call the receiving hospital to arrange for the transfer without waiting for the authorization.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">This question is addressed in greater depth in chapter 4, “Financial Considerations — EMTALA and Managed Care.”</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"></a>Are transfers considered to be emergency department to emergency department?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-2">The EMTALA regulations and <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> specify that transfers are hospital-to- hospital. They do not specify the location at the receiving hospital to which a transfer patient must be routed following arrival at the receiving facility. Although a transferring physician may request an ICU bed or a specific clinical procedure for a patient, the internal routing of the patient at the receiving hospital is within the discretion of the receiving facility, so long as the routing practices are based on clinical considerations. In this regard, transfers may be made from an emergency department to another emergency department, or from an emergency department directly to an inpatient unit, surgery, catheterization laboratory, imaging department or other location within the hospital that meets the patient’s needs.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 ParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"></a>Does the obligation to accept transfers apply during publicly declared emergencies?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-9">As discussed in chapter 16, “Application of EMTALA to Disasters and Public Health Emergencies,” the obligation to accept the transfer of individuals with EMCs is not subject to a waiver during local or national emergencies.</p></li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker005"></a>What documentation on requested transfers should a hospital maintain? </li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Hospitals should have policies and procedures for receiving inquiries from other hospitals, including documentation of calls, the names (if known) and conditions of patients, the outcomes of the calls and the reasons if the hospital refuses to accept the transfer. To avoid an inappropriate denial or delay of a transfer, the policies should also address the routing of transfer requests to personnel who are familiar with the EMTALA regulations.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Hospitals should routinely document inquiries from other hospitals regarding patient transfers. In the absence of documentation, a hospital has no record of being called or having refused  a transfer; however, staff at the transferring hospital usually document in the patient medical record the times of all calls, the persons with whom they spoke and the outcome of the calls. The types of documentation are discussed below in the discussion on communication with transferring hospitals.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> Hospitals should include the review of emergency transfer requests in their performance improvement and risk management programs. It is advisable that the quality management team review all denials of emergency transfer requests, and possible violations of EMTALA should be reported to risk management, compliance and administration.</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"></a>Communication With Transferring Hospitals<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The growing capacity limitations of hospitals and the diminution of on-call coverage at many hospitals have increased the demands on many hospitals that typically act as receiving facilities. In addition, some hospitals have been cited by CMS for an EMTALA violation for failure to accept a patient transfer where there is a dispute over the clinical status of the patient, a communication error or a refusal by an on-call physician at the receiving hospital to accept a transfer. Many receiving hospitals are therefore reviewing their procedures in order to manage their internal acceptance process (and their be<span class="No-break">d/s</span>ervice capacity) and the communications with transferring hospitals and physicians.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The following are some tips for managing the transfer acceptance process:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-10">Review <a href="">IV.&#160;“Communication With Receiving Hospitals,” page&#160;5.10</a>, to gain a perspective on the process that transferring hospitals should follow in implementing a patient transfer.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-10">Decide which department or unit of the hospital should handle requests for patient transfers. The complexity of the EMTALA rules, and the potential disruption and sanctions for an EMTALA violation, support centralization of the transfer acceptance process with trained personnel, transfer acceptance policies and forms for documentation. This does not mean that every receiving hospital must have a transfer center; rather, there should be a designated department or unit with acceptance policies and procedures and trained staff to handle requests for transfer.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-10">Communicate to other hospitals in the area and to other facilities that commonly call requesting a transfer that the hospital has centralized all calls for a transfer to a specific department or unit. As applicable, the hospital should advise transferring hospitals of the telephone number for the department or unit that handles requests for patient transfers.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-10">Advise other hospitals not to contact your on-call physicians before they have communicated with hospital staff and a determination has been made that the hospital has the capacity and capability to meet the needs of the patient.<span class="CharOverride-6"><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap7_rebuild.html#footnote-000">1</a></span></span></li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-10">For all telephone calls seeking a transfer, follow a script and checklist for asking and recording basic information on a standardized patient transfer request form. A sample script and checklist is located in Appendix T, “Sample Transfer Checklist and Script for Accepting Emergency Patients.”</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-10">Determine and document whether the request for a transfer is for an EMTALA or a non-EMTALA patient by asking the questions in Appendix T and recording the answers on the transfer request form.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-10">If the answers to the questions in Appendix T indicate that the transfer is an appropriate transfer under EMTALA, the receiving hospital staff, before contacting an on-call physician, should review and document the receiving hospital’s capacity and capability to accept the transfer and meet the patient’s needs (see sample script and checklist in Appendix T, “Sample Transfer Checklist and Script for Accepting Emergency Patients”).</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-10">If hospital staff confirms its capacity and capability to accept the transfer, the hospital should determine whether there is an appropriate on-call physician who is available to accept the patient and facilitate the direct communication between the on-call physician and the transferring physician. It is usually preferable for the hospital staff to contact the on-call physician and advise him/her of the request and the hospital’s capacity to accept the transfer, before the on-call physician contacts or is contacted by the transferring physician.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-10">As necessary for the hospital and the on-call physician to determine the capacity and capability to accept the patient, the receiving hospital may request that the transferring hospital send portions of the patient medical record (in electronic or hard copy form) in order to evaluate whether it can meet the needs of the patient, so long as the request is:<ol><li class="Body-Styles_Alpha-list _idGenParaOverride-3">Not for financial or insurance information; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Alpha-list _idGenParaOverride-3">In the judgment of the transferring physician, the request does not unduly delay the decision-making process or likely result in further deterioration of the patient’s condition.</li></ol></li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-10">If the on-call physician refuses a transfer for which he/she is available and qualified to accept, trigger the hospital’s chain of command process to expedite a quick review and possible reversal of the decision. <span class="Italic">(See also the discussion under </span><a href=""><span class="Italic">A.&#160;“What if an on-call physician refuses to accept an emergency patient or fails to come to the hospital?,” page&#160;</span><span class="Italic">11.14</span></a><span class="Italic">.)</span></li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-10"><a id="_idIndexMarker006"></a><span class="CharOverride-1">DO NOT REQUEST THE FINANCIAL STATUS OR INSURANCE INFORMATION OF AN EMTALA PATIENT!</span> This information may be obtained only after the receiving hospital has accepted the patient.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-10">Do not place conditions on the transfer, including requests for the transferring hospital to perform more tests, use a specific mode of transport, or take the patient back after the stabilizing services are performed.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-10">If the hospital has a <a id="_idIndexMarker007"></a>transfer agreement with a transferring hospital, make sure the staff is aware of the transfer procedures. A transfer agreement may expedite the transfer process and avoid communication problems between hospitals.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-10">If hospital staff believes that the transferring hospital or physician is not complying with the EMTALA obligations, or there is a dispute or a communication problem, request the opportunity to speak with the administrator-on-call at the transferring hospital to try to resolve the problem. If unsatisfied with the outcome, report the circumstances to administration, risk management or the compliance officer (or other designated staff position) to review the case and decide whether follow-up action is appropriate.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-10">Document the outcome of a transfer acceptance, including the date and time of acceptance, the name of the accepting physician, the bed unit or other designation of the patient, the mode of transport and the expected time of arrival.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-10">If the transfer is refused, document the reasons for the refusal.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-10">Have a performance improvement process for evaluation of the transfer procedures, including review of denied transfers and the documentation of transfer communications.</li></ol><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"></a>Are there state laws requiring hospitals to accept patient transfers? </li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">California law requires that hospitals with statutory or contractual obligations accept a covered patient or, if unable to do so, make appropriate arrangements for the patient’s care.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"></a>Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">A hospital under a statutory or contractual obligation to provide patient care (such as an HMO contract facility) must accept the patient to the extent required by the obligation or, if unable to accept due to a medical hazard, make alternate arrangements for patient care.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"></a>Counties</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">A county hospital must accept a patient whose transfer will not create a medical hazard and who is eligible for county public assistance, unless the county hospital lacks appropriate bed capacity, medical personnel or equipment. If unable to accept a patient, the county must make appropriate arrangements for patient care. However, the law does not set, alter or expand county indigent care obligations nor limit county flexibility to manage county health systems within available resources.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"></a>Medi-Cal</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Welfare and Institutions Code Section 14087.10 requires a contract hospital to accept a Medi-Cal patient transfer from a non-contract hospital if the contract hospital has the capability and capacity to provide the services required by the beneficiary and has a physician with staff privileges who is willing to accept the patient. Hospitals should also review their Medi-Cal contract to determine if there are conditions placed on the hospital’s obligation to accept Medi-Cal patient transfers.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"></a>Other Payers</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Third party payers with statutory or contractual obligations to provide or indemnify emergency services shall be liable, to the extent of the contractual obligation, for the reasonable charges of the transferring hospital and the treating physicians.

			<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"></a>Liability</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">A hospital with a legal obligation to accept patient transfers that does not accept a transfer or make alternative arrangements for medically stable patients is liable for the reasonable charges of the transferring hospital and the treating physicians.
