			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The MSE is defined in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> as a process required to reach a decision as to whether, within reasonable clinical confidence, an individual has an EMC. The MSE must be provided in the same manner to all individuals presenting with similar signs and symptoms.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The MSE is the entry point of EMTALA-mandated services. As discussed in chapter 13, “Regulatory Enforcement of EMTALA,” a recent study found that the failure to provide an appropriate MSE was cited by CMS in 55 percent of EMTALA administrative enforcement actions between 2005 and 2014.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text"><span class="All-Caps-Bold">Note:</span> The initial section of this chapter addresses general questions and issues regarding the conduct of the MSE. There are subsequent sections on requirements for off-campus services and labor and delivery (including newborns). Medical screening of psychiatric patients is briefly discussed in this chapter, and more fully described in chapter 6, “EMTALA and Psychiatric Emergency Patients.” In addition, chapter 2, “When and Where Does EMTALA Begin and End?” includes a discussion of when, where and to whom a MSE must be provided.</p>

The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> require that patients presenting for emergency services must receive a MSE beyond initial triage:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">Triage is not equivalent to a MSE. Triage merely determines the “order” in which patients will be seen, not the presence or absence of an emergency medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip _idGenParaOverride-5"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> Hospitals should ensure that their triage classifications are based on nationally- or industry-recognized standards and that the decisions on triage classifications for emergency patients are consistent with hospital triage policies. In an EMTALA survey in California, CMS cited a hospital for inappropriate triage classification of emergency patients, finding that certain patients were classified in lower triage classifications than the reviewers believed were appropriate based on their presenting complaints, signs and symptoms.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>&#9;References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-6">42 C.F.R.

Instead, CMS has stated that an appropriate MSE will vary according to the patient’s presenting complaint, history and medical condition, as well as the capabilities of the hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In general, an EMTALA enforcement survey team is instructed to identify the scope of  MSEs and patterns of care of a hospital in evaluating compliance with EMTALA. The factors described below — non-discrimination, individual and condition-specific, continuous monitoring and contemporaneous documentation — will be considered in determining whether a MSE is appropriate.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>Non-<a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a>Discrimination</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> state that:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">The MSE must be the same MSE that the hospital would perform on any individual coming to the hospital’s dedicated emergency department with those signs and symptoms, regardless of the individual’s ability to pay for medical care. If a hospital applies in a nondiscriminatory manner (i.e., a different level of care must not exist based on payment status, race, national origin, etc.) a screening process that is reasonably calculated to determine whether an EMC exists, it has met its obligations under EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The tests described in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> are generally consistent with the standards adopted by the federal courts for providing an appropriate medical screening. In <span class="Italic">Jackson v. East Bay Hospital</span> (discussed in chapter 14, “Private Actions to Enforce EMTALA”), the court adopted the “comparative test” that has been followed by other judicial circuits:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">A medical screening must be comparable to the screening provided to patients presenting with similar signs and symptoms, unless the examination is so cursory that it is not designed to identify acute or severe symptoms alerting the physician to a possible emergency condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Although most EMTALA claims for inadequate medical screening focus on whether the examination differed from the screening performed on other patients with similar presenting complaints, signs and symptoms, an unpublished 2007 court decision<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap3_rebuild.html#footnote-001">1</a></span></span> (<span class="Italic">Lewellen v. Schneck Medical Center</span>, also discussed in chapter 14, “Private Actions to Enforce EMTALA”), found that a screening of an intoxicated, injured driver with a burst fracture failed to meet the “cursory screening” test.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> require that the screening must be provided regardless of diagnosis (e.g., labor or AIDS), financial status (e.g., insured or Medicaid), race and color, national origin, disability or other nonmedical factors. California law expressly requires that:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">In no event shall the provision of emergency services and care be based upon, or affected by, the person’s ethnicity, citizenship, age, preexisting medical condition, insurance status, economic status, ability to pay for medical services, or any other characteristic listed or defined in subdivision (b) or (e) of Section 51 of the Civil Code, except to the extent that a circumstance such as age, sex, preexisting medical condition, or physical or mental disability is medically significant to the provision of appropriate medical care to the patient.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap3_rebuild.html#footnote-000">2</a></span></span> [Health and Safety Code Section 1317(b)]</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In performing EMTALA enforcement surveys, the surveyors are instructed to look for possible discrimination based on nonclinical factors as to the manner in which the hospital conducts MSEs. If discrimination based on nonmedical factors (i.e., patient financial status, race or other nonclinical factor) is detected, the surveyors are directed to report the information to  the Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>Individual and Condition-Specific</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The scope of an appropriate MSE must be tailored to the presenting signs and symptoms and the medical history of the individual. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> describe the screening examination as a process that may range from a simple examination (e.g., a brief focused history and examination) to a complex examination that may include laboratory tests, MRI or diagnostic imaging, lumbar punctures an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r other diagnostic tests and procedures. In some cases, the MSE may require a reasonable period of observation and monitoring, or consultation with an on-call specialist, to determine whether the individual has an EMC.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Continuous Monitoring</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> emphasize that a MSE is not an isolated event; it is an ongoing process. The medical record must reflect ongoing monitoring in accordance with the individual’s needs, and must continue until the individual is stabilized or appropriately transferred or discharged.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> provide that the medical record should contain evidence of an evaluation prior to discharge or departure from the hospital for a transfer to another facility.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a>Documentation</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The determination of the appropriateness of the MSE is based on the documentation of the examination. In the Investigative Procedures for EMTALA Surveyors portion of the State Operations Manual, CMS has directed surveyors to determine whether the medical record contains, as appropriate, documentation of the screening, tests, mental status, impressions and diagnosis (supported by a history and physical examination, laboratory tests and other tests and procedures).</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The importance of documentation is critical to demonstrating that the hospital provided an appropriate MSE or other required treatment. In some cases, the charting is incomplete or is missing relevant data, test results and clinical findings. In unusual cases, the medical record should explain the sequence of events, rather than random notes throughout the record or no notes at all. Many hospitals have been cited for failure to provide an adequate MSE or required treatment because of inadequate documentation. Hospitals are therefore encouraged to review a sample of emergency patient medical records, and take corrective action as may be appropriate.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>&#9;References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-6">42 C.F.R.

However, CMS also emphasized that all MSEs do not have to be “equally extensive.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">CMS therefore added a subsection to the EMTALA regulations to address the hospital’s obligations to a non-emergent patient who presents to a dedicated emergency department seeking examination or treatment:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">If an individual comes to a hospital’s dedicated emergency department and a request is made on his or behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition, but the nature of the request makes it clear that the medical condition is not of an emergency nature, the hospital is required only to perform such screening as would be appropriate for any individual presenting in that manner to determine that the individual does not have an emergency medical condition [42 C.F.R. Section 489.24(c)].</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">As an example, CMS described a hypothetical case of an individual who presents to a dedicated emergency department seeking the removal of sutures. The analysis by CMS of  the hypothetical case noted that the patient visit implicated the EMTALA obligations since the individual came to a dedicated emergency department seeking examination and treatment  for a medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">CMS indicated that the hospital may have an emergency nurse, who has been designated  by the hospital and medical staff as a qualified professional to perform an MSE, conduct the MSE examination by obtaining the individual’s history, examining the sutures and determining whether the wound is healing appropriately. If the nurse concludes that the patient does not have an EMC, CMS stated that the EMTALA obligations would be satisfied.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In the preamble to the final regulations, CMS noted, however, that if it is later found that the individual who requested the removal of sutures in fact had an EMC, the extent and quality of the MSE by the nurse would be subject to review to determine whether the MSE was adequate [68 Fed. Reg. 53237].</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Hospitals that propose to use registered nurses to perform the MSE should review the discussion under <a href="EMTALA_Chap3_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor015">H.&#160;&quot;What are the requirements for certifying nurses and other health care professionals to perform medical screening examinations?,&quot; page&#160;3.8</a>, as well as Appendix M.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span><span class="CharOverride-1">&#9;</span>Reference:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-6">42 C.F.R.

CMS has cited as EMTALA violations the use of triage slips, rather than opening a medical record, to record the results of triage or the MSE examination. Even if a patient leaves the hospital after triage and before receiving a MSE, the hospital must open a medical record for the patient and record the results of the visit.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Records should be retained in accordance with applicable state laws and hospital policies, but in no event less than five years from the date of service.

The categories must be listed in the medical staff bylaws or rules and regulations, and approved by the hospital governing body. Although the EMTALA regulations permit a hospital and medical staff to determine the categories of personnel qualified to perform MSEs, CMS has stated that the surveyors are not required to accept the hospital and medical staff’s determination.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The determination of who may perform the MSE is a hospital and medical staff decision. This determination cannot be delegated to the medical director of an emergency service or to a medical staff committee.

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> further provide that a hospital and its medical staff must develop a screening procedure or protocol for non-physicians who perform MSEs. The procedure  or protocol must define when a physician must be contacted for consultation or take responsibility for the patient.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">California law is similar: an MSE must be performed by a physician, or to the extent permitted by applicable law, such as scope-of-practice laws, by other appropriate licensed persons under the supervision of a physician, if within the scope of that person’s license.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> It is recommended that the designations and policies approved by the medical staff and the hospital set forth the basic qualifications for personnel designated to perform MSEs. As appropriate, the rules and regulations should also list any limitations on the ability of designated personnel to perform certain types of examinations (e.g.,, hospitals may have different designation standards for personnel who are authorized to screen normal-risk and high-risk labor patients). The training and in-service requirements for screening personnel should be set  forth in standardized procedures or policies. The hospital must maintain records of personnel who complete in-service education programs. Additional standards must be met for designation of registered nurses to perform MSEs <span class="Italic">(see discussion below)</span>.</p>

Some CAH personnel noted that this language seemed to require a hospital response for patients with non-emergent conditions.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In response to this concern, in 2006, CMS amended the Medicare Conditions of Participation for CAHs to permit a registered nurse, with training and experience in emergency care, to conduct specific MSEs if two conditions are met:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-8">The nurse is on-site and immediately available at the CAH when a patient requests medical care; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-8">The nature of the patient’s request for medical care is within the scope of practice of a registered nurse and consistent with applicable state laws and the CAH’s bylaws or rules and regulations.</li></ol></li>

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In 2013, CMS issued supplemental guidance that a qualified medical person (QMP) on-site at a CAH may be assisted or directed by a qualified telemedicine practitioner in conducting the medical screening examination. Under the guidance, when a non-physician practitioner on- site at a CAH is assisted or directed by a qualified telemedicine physician in the diagnosis or treatment of a patient in a CAH ED, there is no requirement or expectation that the CAH must always require a local on-call physician to come to the ED. However, if hands-on treatment is required beyond the capability of the on-site practitioner, a request for local on-call physician could be required.</p>

The EMTALA TAG reportedly advised CMS that some emergency medical service (EMS) organizations  had cited the memorandum as requiring hospitals to take instant custody of all individuals arriving by EMS transport at the emergency department. In the second memorandum, CMS acknowledged that an emergency department may lack capacity or capability for immediate movement of the patient from the ambulance to a hospital bed.

				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"></a>Does the medical screening examination have to be performed in a <a id="_idIndexMarker020"></a>dedicated emergency department?</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Under the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, an individual must be “initially screened” in the dedicated emergency department before he or she can be moved to another hospital department for further screening and stabilizing treatment.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Therefore, an individual who has been triaged in the dedicated emergency department, but has not received an initial medical screening, cannot be referred to another hospital department. CMS Region IX has indicated that unless the individual presents to the dedicated emergency department seeking directions to another department (e.g., an occupational medicine clinic), the individual must receive an initial medical screening before he or she may be moved to another department for further services.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">However, Region IX has also indicated that women presenting to a dedicated emergency department with labor-related conditions may be directed or otherwise moved to the labor and delivery service without an initial screening in the emergency department, because <a id="_idIndexMarker021"></a>labor and delivery is also considered to be a dedicated emergency department for purposes of EMTALA.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">However, a hospital may not perform triage of patients in the dedicated emergency department, and then refer defined categories of patients (e.g., “nonurgent” patients) to another on-campus hospital department (that is not a dedicated emergency department) to conduct the MSE, unless an initial screening is first completed in the dedicated emergency department.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In addition, a patient who “comes to the emergency department” cannot be moved to a rural health clinic or a private physician’s office for the MSE or stabilizing treatment, even if the  rural health clinic or office is located on the hospital campus.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Following the completion of an initial screening in the dedicated emergency department, a hospital may move patients to another on-campus department if all of the following conditions are met:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">All persons with the same medical conditions are moved to the department, regardless of their ability to pay for treatment.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">There is a “bona fide medical reason” to move the patient.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">“Appropriate” medical personnel accompany the patient to the on-campus location.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The use of the term “appropriate” medical personnel (which replaced “qualified” medical personnel in a prior version of the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>) appears to give hospitals more flexibility in assigning personnel to accompany a patient who is moved to another location for the MSE.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The same guidance about moving patients from the dedicated emergency department also applies to patients who first present to an on-campus hospital department outside of the dedicated emergency department. In that case, the individual cannot be moved to another hospital department for further examination or treatment before the individual receives an  initial screening. An internal movement of a patient within departments of the hospital that are on the hospital campus is not considered to be a “transfer” within the meaning of EMTALA.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Each hospital should adopt <a id="_idIndexMarker022"></a>policies and written directions for the movement of patients to other hospital departments that are on the hospital campus for further screening or necessary stabilizing treatment. A reasonable interpretation of the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> suggests that an attendant or a qualified professional should accompany patients who may need assistance (e.g., for medical reasons or physical or mental disability) to access the on-campus service; as appropriate, patients should be provided escort service, wheelchairs or other assistance to ensure they arrive safely at the on-campus service and that their condition will not be jeopardized by relocation to another department of the hospital.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> If a hospital decides that certain classes of patients do not need personal assistance to access another hospital department for further screening or treatment, the hospital should adopt measures to ensure that patients actually reach the on-campus service. Such measures include written instruction sheets, campus maps, notification to the on-campus service of the patient referral, and follow-up verification of the patient’s arrival. Hospitals may be at risk for an EMTALA violation if a patient decides en route to another department to leave the hospital without notifying hospital personnel. As appropriate, hospitals should consider contacting an eloped patient to determine why the patient left and his or her health status.</p>

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If a patient presents to an on-campus department of the hospital outside of the dedicated emergency department with a possible EMC, the hospital may move the patient to the dedicated emergency department (or another appropriate location on the hospital campus) after an initial screening in order to render further screening and necessary stabilizing treatment. An internal movement of a patient within departments on the hospital campus is not a “transfer” within the meaning of EMTALA.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">However, the movement of the patient from an on-campus department to the dedicated emergency department, <a id="_idIndexMarker026"></a>labor and delivery, or another hospital department must be accomplished in the same manner as moving a patient who has received an initial screening from the main emergency department to another on-campus service.

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> do not address the on-campus relocation of a patient with an EMC who cannot be moved without emergency personnel and secure transport. Due to the multi-block size of many hospital campuses, including crossing public streets between “campus buildings,” it may be unsafe in certain circumstances to move an emergency patient without an ambulance and appropriate personnel and equipment.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Hospitals should develop policies and procedures for moving patients between freestanding buildings on the hospital campus to a dedicated emergency department (including, as necessary, calling <a id="_idIndexMarker027"></a>9-1-1 for patient assistance and transport), and provide in-service education to applicable personnel. The policies should address the procedures to be followed if the ambulance takes the patient to another hospital. The procedures should include contacting the receiving facility and explaining the circumstances of the ambulance transport (in order to avoid the presumption of a possible EMTALA violation) and notification of the event to hospital administration (compliance officer, risk management, etc.)</p>

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">An off-campus department or facility that is not a dedicated emergency department is not subject to EMTALA. However, emergency services provided in these departments and facilities are subject to a Medicare Condition of Participation requiring written <a id="_idIndexMarker029"></a>policies and procedures to be adopted by the hospital governing body for appraisal of emergencies and referral when appropriate.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> adopted by CMS to implement the Medicare Condition of Participation (Appendix E) for off-campus departments require the following:</p>

In addition, off-campus departments are not required to be staffed with professionals with experience handling patients presenting emergency conditions. In the preamble to the 2003 rules, CMS also stated that the policies and procedures for appraisal and referral will apply only within the hours of operation and normal staffing capability of the facility.</p>

Therefore, the labor and delivery service must comply with all of the EMTALA obligations.

As applied to a pregnant woman having contractions, the EMTALA regulations define an “emergency medical condition” as a condition in which there is inadequate time to effect a safe transfer to another hospital before delivery, or when a transfer may pose a threat to the health and safety of the woman or the unborn child. The regulations define “stabilized” as the delivery of the child and placenta.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">If a woman is in labor, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> require that the hospital must deliver the infant or transfer the patient in an appropriate manner:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">She may not be transferred unless she, or a legally responsible person acting on her behalf, requests a transfer and a physician or other qualified medical personnel, in consultation with a physician, certifies that the benefits to the condition of the woman and/or the unborn child outweigh the risks associated with the transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The transfer of a woman in labor is case-specific, and a high priority for EMTALA  enforcement. Therefore, CMS will review the woman’s prenatal history, her condition at the time of presentation to the hospital, the condition of the unborn child at the time of transfer or discharge, the respective capabilities of the transferring and receiving facilities, the expected delivery time and the means of transport. If the hospital discharges a woman having contractions (other than a certified false labor), CMS will closely scrutinize the condition of the woman and her unborn child, the reliability of her support systems and transportation to return to the hospital, and the actions of hospital staff.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">It is recommended that a hospital adopt policies and procedures describing the conditions and written instructions under which a woman having contractions may be sent home, or referred or transferred to another facility. The policies should also designate who may perform the screening and discharge or transfer of the patient, the need for physician consultation  and requirements for countersigning (if applicable) determinations of false labor. Additionally, hospitals should implement quality improvement and risk management reviews of discharges and transfers of women having contractions.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>&#9;References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-6">42 C.F.R.

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In April 2005, CMS issued a memorandum providing guidance that the EMTALA obligations for providing a MSE and stabilizing treatment may apply to infants who are “born alive.” The substance of the memorandum, entitled “Interaction of the Emergency Medical Treatment  and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) and the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002,” has been incorporated in tag no. A-240<span class="No-break">6/C</span>-2406 of the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> (Appendix C).</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Under the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, infants are considered to be “born alive” if they are delivered by any means at any stage of development, and following complete expulsion or extraction, breathe, or have a beating heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord or definite movement of voluntary muscles regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut and regardless of whether the expulsion or extraction occurs as a result of natural or induced labor, C-section or induced labor.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">According to the CMS memorandum, the EMTALA obligations, including medical screening and stabilizing treatment, apply to an infant who is “born alive” in a dedicated emergency department (which includes labor and delivery) if there is a request on the infant’s behalf for, or a prudent layperson would conclude that the infant needs, examination or treatment for a potential EMC.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If the infant is “born alive” at a location on hospital property that is not a dedicated emergency department, an MSE is required if there is a request on the infant’s behalf for, or a prudent layperson would conclude that the infant needs, examination or treatment for a potential EMC.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The CMS guidance on the application of EMTALA to the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act reaffirms that EMTALA does not apply to inpatients. Therefore, CMS has indicated that  an infant who is considered to be an inpatient is covered by the Medicare Conditions of Participation rather than EMTALA.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Hospitals should have written policies and procedures for appraisal of newborns who have acute medical conditions.

The statute was amended in 1988, 1989, 2003 and 2011. EMTALA applies to anyone who presents for emergency services to a hospital that participates in the Medicare program (including psychiatric hospitals). The EMTALA statute is included as Appendix A. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">EMTALA was enacted in response to studies that found that indigent emergency patients had been turned away from hospitals for necessary services or transferred (i.e., “dumped”) to public and charity hospitals in an unstabilized condition. Although EMTALA was passed to mandate access to emergency services by the indigent, Congress applied the EMTALA requirements to all patients regardless of financial or insurance status. In general, both the federal regulatory agencies and the courts have defined the primary objectives of EMTALA as twofold: to enhance access by all persons to emergency services and to prohibit <a id="_idIndexMarker000"></a>discrimination in the provision of emergency services to persons presenting with the same or similar types of conditions. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"></a>The EMTALA Regulations <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The initial EMTALA regulations were published in draft form in 1988, and issued as interim final regulations on June 22, 1994. On April 7, 2000, the regulations were amended to apply the EMTALA obligations to off-campus hospital services. In September 2003, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (<a id="_idIndexMarker001"></a>CMS) published further changes to the EMTALA regulations, repealing part of the 2000 regulations and clarifying the application of EMTALA to emergency patients, outpatients and inpatients. Since 2004, CMS has amended the EMTALA regulations in piecemeal fashion in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. The current regulations are included as Appendix B. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>The EMTALA <span class="CharOverride-1">Interpretive Guidelines</span> <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><a id="_idIndexMarker002"></a>CMS has adopted <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> as part of the <span class="Italic">Medicare State Operations Manual</span> to provide guidance for federal and state surveyors in their enforcement of EMTALA. Although the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> are not regulations, they are considered the official interpretation of EMTALA by CMS and are used by California Department of Public Health (CDPH) surveyors and CMS regional offices in enforcement of the EMTALA obligations. The most recent update to the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> was July 16, 2010; the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> are included as Appendix C. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="All-Caps-Bold">Note:</span> The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> are organized by “<a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a>tag numbers,” each of which corresponds to a CMS regulation that establishes the rules for EMTALA.

The Bulletin discusses the rules on seeking health plan authorization prior to the medical screening examination (which were added to the EMTALA regulations in 2003), dual staffing of emergency departments and recommended patient registration practices to minimize violations of EMTALA. The Bulletin is discussed in chapter 4, “Financial Considerations — EMTALA and Managed Care,” and is included as Appendix H. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">From time to time, CMS issues Program Memoranda on various subjects relating to EMTALA obligations.

As described in chapter 13, “Regulatory Enforcement of EMTALA,” the federal agencies charged with ensuring EMTALA compliance are CMS and the OIG. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">CMS has the authority to conduct complaint and enforcement surveys for EMTALA compliance, and to terminate a hospital’s Medicare provider agreement upon confirming one or more violations of EMTALA. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Under the EMTALA statute (Appendix A), the OIG has the authority to impose civil money penalties up to $50,000 against hospitals and physicians ($25,000 for hospitals with less than 100 beds), an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r to exclude a hospital or physician from the Medicare and Medicaid programs for violations of EMTALA that are “gross and flagrant or repeated.” In December 2016, the OIG issued final regulations updating the amount of civil money penalties, including EMTALA fines. Effective in 2017, the OIG may now impose civil penalties up to $104,826 against hospitals and physicians ($52,414 for hospitals with less than 100 beds) for an EMTALA violation. The maximum amount of the fines is subject to annual adjustment for inflation. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The regional <a id="_idIndexMarker007"></a>quality improvement organization (QIO) is responsible for assisting CMS and OIG review patient stabilization and other medical matters pertaining to the delivery of emergency care and services. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">For hospitals that have community service obligations under the <a id="_idIndexMarker008"></a>Hill-Burton Act, the <a id="_idIndexMarker009"></a>Office for Civil Rights (OCR) will follow up on violations of EMTALA confirmed by CMS with a request for copies of EMTALA compliance, transfer, admission and other hospital policies.  </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>EMTALA Committees and Reports <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Since 2001, there have been a number of committees and governmental agencies that have issued reports on EMTALA, including reports regarding compliance by hospitals and physicians with EMTALA standards, the enforcement process and the overall effect of the law. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker010"></a>Office of Inspector General </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In January 2001, the OIG released two reports on EMTALA: “Survey of Hospital Emergency Departments” and “The Enforcement Process.” </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIG’s “Survey of Hospital Emergency Departments” made the following findings: </p><ol>

					</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIG reported that CMS concurred with its recommendations. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In “The Enforcement Process” report, the OIG issued the following findings on the EMTALA enforcement process: </p><ol>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">The EMTALA enforcement process is compromised by long delays and inadequate feedback. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The number of EMTALA investigations and their ultimate disposition vary widely by CMS region and year. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Poor tracking of EMTALA cases impede oversight. </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Peer review is not always obtained before CMS considers terminating a hospital for medical reasons. </li>
					</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The OIG report recommended that CMS increase its oversight of the regional offices, improve collection and access to EMTALA data, ensure that peer review occurs for cases involving medical judgment, and establish an EMTALA technical advisory group. The OIG reported that CMS concurred with its recommendations. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker011"></a>General Accountability Office </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In June 2001, the U.S. General Accountability Office (GAO) released its own report entitled “EMTALA Implementation and Enforcement Issues.” Among other findings, the GAO reported that providers generally support the goals of EMTALA, but are uncertain about the extent of their obligations and have concerns about its effects on emergency care. In Table 1 of the report, the GAO listed seven issues identified as provider uncertainties: </p><ol>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">Scope of the medical screening exam </li>

					</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The comments by CMS on those issues are addressed in various sections of this manual. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Regarding the enforcement of EMTALA, the GAO reported that most EMTALA violations involve failure to screen, stabilize or transfer appropriately. They noted that although hospitals have concerns about CMS enforcement, CMS usually accepts corrective action plans and rarely terminates hospitals from the Medicare program. Finally, the GAO found that the OIG focuses on future compliance in assessing fines for EMTALA violations, and generally does not pursue a physician in the absence of clearly culpable behavior. The GAO endorsed many of the OIG recommendations in the two earlier reports discussed above. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In April 2009, the GAO issued a report entitled “Hospital Emergency Departments — Crowding Continues to Occur, and Some Patients Wait Longer than Recommended Time Frames.” The report looked at indicators of emergency department crowding, including ambulance diversion, wait times and patient boarding. The report determined that the primary factor for emergency department crowding is the lack of inpatient beds, with the following secondary factors: lack of access to primary care, a shortage of available on-call specialists and difficulties with transferring or discharging psychiatric patients. The report, “GAO-09-347,” can be accessed on the GAO website at <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09347.pdf" target="_system">www.gao.go<span class="No-break">v/n</span>ew.item<span class="No-break">s/</span><span class="No-break">d</span>09347.pdf</a>. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a>EMTALA <a id="_idIndexMarker013"></a>Technical Advisory Group </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In the 2003 Medicare reform legislation, Congress directed the Secretary of HHS to establish a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to solicit advice concerning the EMTALA regulations and enforcement. The Secretary signed the charter establishing the TAG on May 11, 2004; the TAG had a term of 30 months. The TAG was composed of 19 members, including four hospital representatives and seven physicians. The final meeting of the TAG was Sept. 17-18, 2007. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The TAG had the following responsibilities: </p><ol>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-2">Review the EMTALA regulations; </li>
						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Provide advice and recommendations to the Secretary concerning the regulations and their application to hospitals and physicians; </li>

						<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Disseminate information on the EMTALA regulations to providers and the public. </li>
					</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">During its tenure, the TAG issued seven reports and made several recommendations to CMS, some of which resulted in changes to the regulations and others in updated guidance issued in Program Memoranda. At its final meeting, the TAG adopted a series of recommendations related to accepting hospital obligations, clarification of conditions that constitute an “emergency medical condition,” clarification of the term “stabilization” (including a proposed concept of “temporary stabilization”), and procedures and criteria for transferring patients with stabilized conditions to physician offices for follow-up evaluation and care. It is uncertain whether these recommendations will be accepted by CMS, and if so, whether there will be any changes. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Further information on the TAG, including meeting agendas and reports, is available on the CMS website at <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/EMTALA/03_emtalatag.asp" target="_system">www.cms.hhs.go<span class="No-break">v/E</span>MTAL<span class="No-break">A/0</span>3_emtalatag.asp</a>. </p></li></ol></li>
					<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"></a>EMTALA Compliance <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Hospitals should adopt a hospital-wide policy that commits the facility to comply with EMTALA, as well as quality improvement, risk management and corporate compliance programs to monitor adherence with EMTALA standards. A model policy is included as Appendix O. Other recommended EMTALA policies are discussed throughout this manual and are listed in Appendix N. </p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker014"></a>State Laws <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The EMTALA statute expressly provides that the federal obligations do not preempt state and local emergency laws unless they conflict with the EMTALA obligations. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Some states have adopted emergency services statutes or regulations. Readers of this manual should consult with their legal counsel as to the effect of these laws. (Relevant California laws are discussed in this manual.) </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">In 1987, the California Legislature amended the hospital licensing laws to enact state patient anti-dumping laws. The California emergency medical service requirements are similar to EMTALA requirements, with some exceptions that are discussed in this manual. The following are some examples: </p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">California law applies to hospitals that are licensed to provide emergency services; EMTALA applies to all hospitals that provide emergency services, even if they do not have licensed emergency departments. </li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">California law expressly prohibits <a id="_idIndexMarker015"></a>discrimination in the provision of emergency services by hospitals and physicians. </li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-3">EMTALA focuses on whether a patient with an emergency condition is “stabilized” for transfer or discharge; California law primarily focuses on transfers that are made for nonmedical reasons (e.g., insurance or financial reasons), which apply to patients with emergency conditions that are considered to be stabilized. California law does not apply to a transfer that is made for medical reasons (although other state requirements pertaining to the transfer of patients may apply). </li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The California licensing laws on “emergency services and care” are included as Appendix D. </p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The EMTALA regulations contain a series of defined terms that are essential to the regulatory scheme.

If    a hospital has outpatient clinics that are listed on and operated under the hospital license (often referred to in California as 1206(d) clinics), the clinics are considered  to be part of the hospital and are subject to EMTALA if they are located on hospital property.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Indent-1 _idGenParaOverride-3">EMTALA does not apply to skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, or rural health clinics that are operated by hospitals, even if the facilities or clinics are listed on the hospital license.

In addition, EMTALA does not apply to hospital-owned suppliers of Medicare services that are billed separately from hospital services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Indent-1 _idGenParaOverride-3">In some instances, a hospital company may operate <a id="_idIndexMarker008"></a>clinics that are separately licensed or exempt from licensing. Examples of licensed clinics in California include “community clinics” and “surgical clinics,” both of which are subject to clinic licensing laws, and are listed on the hospital license or subject to hospital regulations. Examples of clinics that are exempt from licensing include primary care clinics operated by counties or other public agencies, clinics affiliated with teaching institutions, medical care foundation clinics and imaging centers.

The term intended to distinguish between hospital departments that are held out as services for persons with urgent and emergency medical problems and other hospital departments   that primarily serve scheduled outpatients for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. As discussed below, the distinction is not always clear to providers and patients.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">A <span class="Bold">“dedicated emergency department”</span> is defined in the EMTALA regulations as a hospital department or facility that is located on the hospital campus or <a id="_idIndexMarker010"></a>off-campus, and meets any one of the following tests:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idIndexMarker011"></a><span class="Bold">License Test.</span> The department or facility is licensed by the state in which it is located as an emergency room or department;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idIndexMarker012"></a><span class="Bold">Holding Out Test.</span> The department or facility is held out to the public (by name, signs, advertising or other means) as a place that provides care for emergency medical conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment; or</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idIndexMarker013"></a><span class="Bold">One-Third Test.</span> The department or facility, based on a representative sample of patient visits within the preceding calendar year, provides at least one-third of all of its outpatient visits for the treatment of emergency medical conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment.</li></ol></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>How will CMS determine if a hospital department is a dedicated emergency department under the one-third test?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, CMS has provided guidance to the CMS regional offices and state<a id="_idIndexMarker014"></a> survey agencies to determine whether a hospital department meets the one-third test. The surveyor is directed to select a sample of patient visits to the department that occurred during the previous calendar year. The surveyor will review the facility log, appointment   roster and other appropriate information to identify the patients seen in the department or facility. The surveyor will then review 20 to 50 medical records of patients for diagnoses or presenting complaints; in consultation with the CMS regional office, the surveyor may expand the sample size in order to conduct an adequate investigation. The patient sample will be selected by the surveyor, not the hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The surveyor must then determine the number of patients who “had an emergency medical condition and received stabilizing treatment.” If one-third of the sample cases were for the treatment of emergency conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment, the department or facility will be considered to be a dedicated emergency department. The Investigative Procedures for EMTALA Surveyors portion of   the <span class="Italic">State Operations Manual</span> (Appendix K) notes that this procedure will apply to specialty hospitals (e.g., <a id="_idIndexMarker015"></a>psychiatric facilities), hospitals without a traditional emergency department, and <a id="_idIndexMarker016"></a>urgent care centers. In addition, the procedure may apply to both on-campus and off- campus departments and facilities of the hospital.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Are <a id="_idIndexMarker017"></a>labor and delivery and <a id="_idIndexMarker018"></a>psychiatric services considered dedicated emergency departments under EMTALA?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the preamble to the 2003 regulations, CMS reaffirmed that a dedicated emergency department includes not only what is generally considered to be a hospital’s “emergency room,” but also other departments of hospitals, such as labor and delivery and psychiatric units. As stated by CMS:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-8">Any area of the hospital that offers such medical services to treat individuals in labor to at least one-third of the ambulatory individuals who present to the area for care, even if the hospital’s practice is to admit such individuals as inpatients rather than listing them on an outpatient basis, <span class="CharOverride-6">would</span> be considered a dedicated emergency department. (Emphasis in original) [68 Fed. Reg. 53229]</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In recent years, CMS has been closely looking at freestanding acute psychiatric hospitals to determine whether they operate dedicated emergency departments for “walk-in” or other non-scheduled patients.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a>Are hospital urgent care centers and other ambulatory departments dedicated emergency departments under EMTALA?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idIndexMarker019"></a>In the preamble to the 2003 regulations, CMS rejected a request to exclude hospital urgent care centers from the EMTALA requirements, stating:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-8">We believe that it would be very difficult for any individual in need of emergency care to distinguish between a hospital department that provides care for an ‘urgent need’ and one that provides care for an ‘emergency medical condition’ need ... . As we have discussed above, if the department or facility is held out    to the public as a place that provides care for emergency medical conditions, it would meet the definition of dedicated emergency department. An urgent care center of this kind would fall under this criterion for dedicated emergency department status [68 Fed. Reg. 53431].</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">However, other guidance from CMS suggests that urgent care and other hospital departments that provide drop-in services for urgent and non-urgent conditions are not automatically considered to be dedicated emergency departments. For example, as noted above, the Investigative Procedures for EMTALA Surveyors portion of the <span class="Italic">State Operations Manual </span>states that the procedure to apply the “one-third test” may apply to an urgent care center or other hospital department only if more than one-third of the center’s or department’s patients presented for the treatment of “emergency” conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment. The guidance suggests that patients presenting only for treatment of “urgent” or “non-urgent” conditions on a drop-in basis will not result in the classification of the urgent care center or other department as a dedicated emergency department.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In addition, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> adopted to implement the Medicare Conditions of Participation for hospital outpatient services [42 C.F.R. Section 482.55] note that urgent care clinics may be organized as part of an <a id="_idIndexMarker020"></a>outpatient department or an emergency department. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> then state that an urgent care clinic will be evaluated for compliance with the integration standards for outpatient services (rather than the integration standards for emergency departments) if three conditions are met:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The urgent care clinic is held out to the public as providing only urgent care services and possibly other services;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The hospital clearly advises the public that the urgent care clinic is not an emergency department; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-6">The urgent care clinic does not meet the definition of a dedicated emergency department under EMTALA.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In some states, urgent care centers and similar departments are licensed as outpatient services. For example, in California, an outpatient service is defined as “the rendering of nonemergency health care” to patients [Title 22, California Code of Regulations, Section 70525].</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As indicated in this discussion, there is some confusion as to whether urgent care centers and similar drop-in hospital departments (e.g., an <a id="_idIndexMarker021"></a>occupational medicine clinic) that are not licensed or operated as typical emergency departments are dedicated emergency departments within the meaning of EMTALA. How an urgent care center is held out to the public may be a critical factor in whether an urgent care center is treated as a dedicated emergency department or excepted from EMTALA. This is illustrated in a 2016 court decision that focused on the signage for a hospital-operated urgent care center. The hospital argued that its website clearly stated that its urgent care center was for non-emergency  needs. However, the court noted that the on-site signage for the urgent care center did not distinguish between urgent care and emergent care; therefore, a person driving by the urgent care center (in this instance, with chest pains) would be unlikely to check the website before entering the urgent care center. As a result, the court declined to rule in favor of the hospital based on the patient’s perception from the signage that the clinic would be an appropriate place to receive emergency care. This case, <span class="Italic">Friedrich et at. v. South County Hospital Healthcare System, et al.</span>, is discussed in chapter 14.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> The broad definition of dedicated emergency department requires  a hospital to evaluate all of its ambulatory care departments (on- and off-campus) to identify the services that meet the definition of a dedicated emergency department. In addition to reviewing the volume of drop-in patients, the hospital should also review its website, signage, advertising, other promotional materials, and information disseminated to the public regarding the availability of drop-in services.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a>How does EMTALA apply to a hospital that does not have a dedicated emergency department?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The first subsection of the EMTALA statute triggers the medical screening obligation for an individual who comes to a “hospital that has an emergency department.” However, the second subsection of the EMTALA statute triggers the obligations for further examination and stabilizing treatment and transfers for an individual “who comes to a hospital.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The EMTALA regulations define a <span class="Bold">“hospital with an emergency department”</span> as “a hospital with a dedicated emergency department.” The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> indicate that hospitals that do not provide emergency services must meet the standards of the Medicare Conditions of Participation [42 C.F.R. Section 482.12(f)(2); <span class="Italic">see Appendix E</span>], which require all participating hospitals to have written <a id="_idIndexMarker022"></a>policies and procedures for the appraisal of emergencies, initial treatment within the capability and capacity of the hospital, and appropriate referral of emergency patients to hospitals that are capable of providing the necessary emergency services. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> for Section 482.12(f) require that staff at any hospital location know how to respond to individuals (patients, staff, visitors and others) seeking or in need of medical and psychiatric emergency services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> state that a hospital with a dedicated emergency department  must comply with the medical screening, stabilizing treatment, transfer and other obligations of EMTALA. However, all hospitals participating in the Medicare program, regardless of maintaining a dedicated emergency department, are subject to the Medicare receiving hospital obligation, and must accept an appropriate transfer of an individual with an emergency medical condition who requires specialized capabilities not available at the transferring hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Hospitals (including critical access hospitals) that do not have a physician present in the hospital on a full-time basis must provide a written <a id="_idIndexMarker023"></a>notice to all patients at the beginning of their hospital stay or outpatient visit stating that a physician is not present in the hospital 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The notice must explain how the hospital will meet the medical needs of a patient who develops an emergency medical condition during the course of an inpatient stay or outpatient encounter at a time when no physician is present in the hospital. The law states that an inpatient stay or outpatient encounter is considered to begin with    the provision of a package of information regarding scheduled preadmission testing and registration for a planned hospital admission for inpatient care or outpatient service. Prior to admitting the patient or providing an outpatient service, the hospital must receive a signed acknowledgment from the patient indicating the patient’s understanding that a physician may not be present in the hospital at all times. The notice is a condition of the Medicare provider agreement, a violation of which may result in termination of the agreement.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If a hospital does not have a dedicated emergency department, it is recommended that the hospital consult with its legal counsel to determine:</p><ol>

Hospitals should consult with their legal counsel regarding how the appointment programs implicate the EMTALA obligations. In the absence of guidance from CMS regarding the effect of appointment reservation programs in the emergency department, the best practice for hospitals is to comply with the EMTALA requirements for patients who sign up for an appointment at a dedicated emergency department.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"></a>Presentation to an On-Campus Hospital Department that is Not a Dedicated Emergency Department</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">If an individual has a scheduled appointment to receive care from a hospital service that is not a dedicated emergency department (e.g., an imaging procedure, laboratory test, physical therapy session or cardiac rehabilitation program), EMTALA does not apply to the patient once he or she has begun an “encounter” with a health care professional in the department. For purposes of EMTALA, an “encounter” is a “direct personal contact” between  a patient and a physician or other caregiver who may order or furnish hospital diagnostic or treatment services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In addition, EMTALA does not apply if the patient, during the course of his or her outpatient encounter, requests or is in obvious need of emergency services (e.g.,, the patient has a cardiac arrest while on the treadmill), even if the patient is moved to a dedicated emergency department for further examination and stabilizing treatment. Instead, CMS will apply the Medicare Conditions of Participation to the examination and treatment rendered to the outpatient if the need for emergency care arises during his or her encounter.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">As an example, CMS has described the hypothetical case of an outpatient who comes  to the physical therapy department for a scheduled appointment. During the encounter, the patient experiences chest pains and lightheadedness, and is taken to the dedicated emergency department for follow-up examination and treatment. Although personnel in the dedicated emergency department may (and should) provide emergency services to the patient in the same manner as any other patient presenting to the department with similar signs and symptoms, the EMTALA obligations will not apply to the patient since the need for emergency care arose during the outpatient encounter in the physical therapy department. Instead, the response by the hospital is subject to the standards of the Medicare Conditions of Participation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">Although not expressly stated in the regulations, it appears that EMTALA applies to an outpatient if he or she requests or is in need of emergency services prior to the encounter or after the encounter is completed (e.g.,, the patient faints or has a medical crisis while leaving the hospital or in the parking lot).</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-5"><span class="Reference-mark CharOverride-3">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-3">42 C.F.R.

In some cases, the referring physician has seen the patient immediately preceding the patient’s arrival at the hospital; in other cases, the physician has not seen the patient prior to his or her arrival at the hospital, but may have provided an ongoing course of treatment to the patient. Occasionally, a patient is directed to meet his or her primary care physician in the emergency department for examination or treatment.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the preamble to the 2003 regulations, CMS reaffirmed that EMTALA applies to any individual who presents to a dedicated emergency department seeking examination or treatment for any medical condition. As noted by CMS, pharmaceutical services in a dedicated emergency department may be for medical conditions, and are therefore subject to EMTALA [68 Fed. Reg. 53235]. EMTALA will apply if an individual presents for injections  or other treatment for a medical condition, even if the individual arrives with orders from an attending staff member. Therefore, hospitals should record these patients in the central log, open a medical record and provide a medical screening examination.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">This position expressed by CMS in the preamble is reinforced in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>. CMS states that if a patient presents to a dedicated emergency department for pharmaceutical services for a medical condition, the hospital “generally” has an EMTALA obligation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The CMS position, however, implies that not all requests by patients presenting to a dedicated emergency department for pharmaceutical services implicate EMTALA, and therefore require a medical screening examination. However, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> do not provide sufficient guidance to determine the categories of medication requests that do not trigger the EMTALA obligations. Hospitals and their medical staffs should also consider regulatory and risk management issues when deciding whether to administer medication in the absence of a medical screening examination for patients presenting to an emergency department for pharmaceutical services. Therefore, the best practice is for hospitals to provide a medical screening examination, and other EMTALA-required services, to patients presenting for pharmaceutical services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">It is noted that EMTALA does not require a hospital to provide medication to patients who,  as a result of the medical screening examination, are determined not to have an emergency medical condition. As stated by CMS, EMTALA does not require a hospital to provide medication to a non-emergent patient “because the individual is unable to pay or does not wish to purchase the medication from a retail pharmacy or did not plan appropriately to secure prescription refills.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">If an individual comes to a hospital department that is not a dedicated emergency department with a prescription or seeking pharmaceutical services, the EMTALA obligations will not apply to the request unless the individual requests or is in obvious need of examination or treatment for what may be an emergency medical condition. In these cases, hospitals should follow their standard policies and procedures for pharmacy services requested by nonemergency patients.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">Although the EMTALA obligations apply to all individuals who present to a dedicated emergency department, hospitals may tailor their medical screenings for patients who   present at a dedicated emergency department for nonemergency services.

However, CMS has indicated that EMTALA does not apply to individuals who present to a dedicated emergency department and request services that are not an examination or treatment for a medical condition. Some examples of these situations include the following.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker030"></a>Preventive Care Services</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the preamble to the 2003 EMTALA regulations, CMS, without explanation, listed “preventive health services” as one example of a request for services that does not trigger the requirement for a medical screening examination [68 Fed. Reg. 53235]. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> provide three examples of “preventive care services” — immunizations, allergy shots and flu shots.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">However, if a person presenting for these types of preventive care services requests or is in need of an examination for a medical condition, EMTALA may apply and the patient should be treated in the same manner as other patients presenting for emergency services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker031"></a>Blood Pressure Checks</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the past, CMS Region IX has suggested that EMTALA probably does not apply to persons presenting to an emergency department for routine blood pressure checks offered as a community service to all area residents.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> qualify this past advice. As explained by CMS, a hospital may  have a policy or protocol (or, as applicable, a standardized procedure) permitting a qualified professional in a dedicated emergency department to conduct medical screenings within his or her scope of practice. As an example, CMS cites a request for a blood pressure check. If a person presenting for a routine blood pressure check, upon screening, has a reading within normal limits and there are no other signs or symptoms indicating the presence of an emergency medical condition, the hospital is not required under EMTALA to provide services beyond what was needed to determine the absence of an emergency condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">However, if a person presenting for a routine blood pressure check also requests or is in need of an examination for a medical condition, EMTALA may apply and the patient should be treated in the same manner as other patients presenting for emergency services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"></a>Blood Alcohol Tests and Sexual Assault Cases</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the preamble to the 2003 regulations, CMS stated that requests by law enforcement personnel for <a id="_idIndexMarker032"></a>medical clearance of incarcerated patients, or blood alcohol or other tests to   be used as evidence in criminal proceedings, would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the hospital is required to provide a medical screening and other required EMTALA services [68 Fed. Reg. 53235].</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> provide additional direction for hospitals in law enforcement   cases. In general, the “gathering of evidence for criminal law cases (e.g., sexual assault,   blood alcohol test)” does not trigger the requirements for a medical screening examination or other EMTALA required services. However, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> qualify this exemption from EMTALA:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-8">If an individual is brought to the ED and law enforcement personnel request  that emergency department personnel draw blood for a BAT only and [do] not request examination or treatment for a medical condition, such as intoxication, and a <a id="_idIndexMarker033"></a>prudent layperson would not believe that the individual needed such examination or treatment, then the EMTALA’s screening requirement is not applicable to this situation because the request made on behalf of the individual was for evidence. However, if for example, the individual in police custody was involved in a motor vehicle accident or may have sustained   injury to him or herself and presents to the ED, a MSE would be warranted to determine if an EMC exists.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> further clarify that requests for pre-jail clearance trigger the EMTALA obligations, and that hospitals should provide a medical screening examination to determine whether the individual has an emergency medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">With respect to rape and sexual assault cases, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> state that the same principle described above for blood alcohol testing also applies to individuals presenting to a dedicated emergency department in connection with rape or sexual assault.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In summary, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> direct surveyors to review each case on its own    merits to determine whether EMTALA applies to law enforcement requests. In conducting   staff in-service training, hospitals should consider that even if law enforcement personnel do not request medical care for a patient in custody, the EMTALA obligations will be triggered if a prudent layperson would believe that the patient’s behavior or appearance indicates the need to provide examination or treatment for a medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">For further guidance on medical procedures requested by law enforcement, California hospitals should review chapter 6 of CHA’s <span class="Italic">Consent Manual</span>.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"></a>Other Nonemergency Tests</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, CMS states that the presentation by an individual to a  dedicated emergency department for the collection of evidence (e.g., a lab test) does not trigger the EMTALA obligations so long as the request does not include analysis of the lab results or an examination or treatment of the individual.

If the ambulance still brings the individual to the hospital, the patient is considered to have “come to the emergency department” and the hospital must accept the person and provide a medical screening examination.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In a 2001 9th Circuit Court of Appeal decision, <a id="_idIndexMarker036"></a><span class="Italic">Arrington v.

In  the <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> case, a patient with “severe respiratory distress” was in a nonhospital-owned ambulance on the way to a hospital when the ambulance personnel contacted the hospital. The emergency physician asked the name of the patient’s physician and told the ambulance personnel that he believed that “it would be okay” to redirect the ambulance to the patient’s aligned facility (in this case, an Army medical center). The total ambulance time with change in direction was 16 minutes. As discussed in chapter 14, “Private Actions to Enforce EMTALA,” the court interpreted the phrase “comes to the emergency department” as including an individual who is en route to the hospital. Since the hospital was not on diversion, the court ruled that the hospital could not redirect the ambulance.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">CMS has informally indicated that it does not consider the <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> decision to be consistent with the EMTALA regulations or binding on EMTALA enforcement.

Some EMS agencies have adopted policies that include standards for a non-destination hospital to which an ambulance may divert during the course of an arranged transport to a trauma center or  other facility. These policies do not override the EMTALA obligations. If the ambulance crew or the patient requests examination or treatment at a non-destination hospital, the EMTALA obligations may apply, and the hospital must enter the patient in the central log, open a patient record, conduct a medical screening, provide treatment within its capability and reconfirm the transfer to the destination facility.

For several years, there has been a split in opinion between the federal circuit  courts of appeal as to whether EMTALA applies to inpatients, including the transfer and discharge of inpatients in an unstabilized condition. Prior to the 2003 EMTALA regulations,   the 1st and 6th Circuit Courts of Appeal applied EMTALA to inpatient discharges and  transfers. In contrast, the 4th and 9th Circuit Courts of Appeal declined to extend EMTALA to the treatment, transfer or discharge of inpatients. These cases are discussed in chapter 14, “Private Actions to Enforce EMTALA.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In <span class="Italic">Roberts v. Galen of Virginia, Inc.</span>, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals applied EMTALA to the transfer of an inpatient in an allegedly unstabilized condition to a long-term care facility after   a two-month hospital stay. During oral argument on an appeal of the Court’s decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Solicitor General (on behalf of the federal government) advised    the Court that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services would adopt regulations clarifying whether EMTALA applied to inpatients.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In 2003, CMS addressed the “inpatient” issue by providing that the EMTALA obligations    are terminated when an individual is admitted in good faith for inpatient care in order to stabilize an emergency medical condition. The regulations adopt the definition of “inpatient” in the Medicare Hospital Manual: “a person who has been admitted to a hospital for bed occupancy for purposes of receiving inpatient hospital services.” However, CMS warned  that EMTALA will apply if a hospital admits an emergency patient in bad faith (i.e., to avoid EMTALA requirements), and then inappropriately transfers or discharges the individual without meeting the stabilization requirement.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">The EMTALA regulations apply to the interpretation and enforcement of EMTALA by CMS. They are not binding on the courts. In a 2009 decision, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals observed that the regulation excluding inpatients from EMTALA “is contrary to the plain language” of the EMTALA statute. In the case, the inpatient stay occurred prior to the 2003 change in the regulations, so the decision did not strike down the regulation. In 2012, a district court in Texas reached a similar conclusion. The decisions, <span class="Italic">Moses v. Providence Hospital and Medical Ctrs.</span> and <span class="Italic">Liles v.

The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> clarify that emergency patients who are placed in <a id="_idIndexMarker039"></a>observation status are not inpatients, even if they occupy a bed overnight in the observation unit. Therefore, the receiving hospital obligation applies to the transfer of an emergency patient in observation status.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">In 2012, CMS confirmed, in commentary, that it was maintaining its current policy that EMTALA obligations end when an individual is admitted in good faith for inpatient care in order to stabilize an emergency medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-5">Inpatients continue to be subject to the standards and protections of the Medicare Conditions of Participation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-5"><span class="Reference-mark CharOverride-3">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-3">42 C.F.R.

Instead, CMS has stated that an appropriate MSE will vary according to the patient’s presenting complaint, history and medical condition, as well as the capabilities of the hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In general, an EMTALA enforcement survey team is instructed to identify the scope of  MSEs and patterns of care of a hospital in evaluating compliance with EMTALA. The factors described below — non-discrimination, individual and condition-specific, continuous monitoring and contemporaneous documentation — will be considered in determining whether a MSE is appropriate.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>Non-<a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a>Discrimination</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> state that:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">The MSE must be the same MSE that the hospital would perform on any individual coming to the hospital’s dedicated emergency department with those signs and symptoms, regardless of the individual’s ability to pay for medical care.

In <span class="Italic">Jackson v.

California law expressly requires that:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">In no event shall the provision of emergency services and care be based upon, or affected by, the person’s ethnicity, citizenship, age, preexisting medical condition, insurance status, economic status, ability to pay for medical services, or any other characteristic listed or defined in subdivision (b) or (e) of Section 51 of the Civil Code, except to the extent that a circumstance such as age, sex, preexisting medical condition, or physical or mental disability is medically significant to the provision of appropriate medical care to the patient.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap3_rebuild.html#footnote-000" data-href="footnote-000">2</a></span></span> [Health and Safety Code Section 1317(b)]</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In performing EMTALA enforcement surveys, the surveyors are instructed to look for possible discrimination based on nonclinical factors as to the manner in which the hospital conducts MSEs. If discrimination based on nonmedical factors (i.e., patient financial status, race or other nonclinical factor) is detected, the surveyors are directed to report the information to  the Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>Individual and Condition-Specific</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The scope of an appropriate MSE must be tailored to the presenting signs and symptoms and the medical history of the individual. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> describe the screening examination as a process that may range from a simple examination (e.g., a brief focused history and examination) to a complex examination that may include laboratory tests, MRI or diagnostic imaging, lumbar punctures an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r other diagnostic tests and procedures. In some cases, the MSE may require a reasonable period of observation and monitoring, or consultation with an on-call specialist, to determine whether the individual has an EMC.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Continuous Monitoring</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> emphasize that a MSE is not an isolated event; it is an ongoing process.

In the Investigative Procedures for EMTALA Surveyors portion of the State Operations Manual, CMS has directed surveyors to determine whether the medical record contains, as appropriate, documentation of the screening, tests, mental status, impressions and diagnosis (supported by a history and physical examination, laboratory tests and other tests and procedures).</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The importance of documentation is critical to demonstrating that the hospital provided an appropriate MSE or other required treatment. In some cases, the charting is incomplete or is missing relevant data, test results and clinical findings. In unusual cases, the medical record should explain the sequence of events, rather than random notes throughout the record or no notes at all. Many hospitals have been cited for failure to provide an adequate MSE or required treatment because of inadequate documentation. Hospitals are therefore encouraged to review a sample of emergency patient medical records, and take corrective action as may be appropriate.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-6">42 C.F.R.

However, CMS also emphasized that all MSEs do not have to be “equally extensive.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">CMS therefore added a subsection to the EMTALA regulations to address the hospital’s obligations to a non-emergent patient who presents to a dedicated emergency department seeking examination or treatment:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">If an individual comes to a hospital’s dedicated emergency department and a request is made on his or behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition, but the nature of the request makes it clear that the medical condition is not of an emergency nature, the hospital is required only to perform such screening as would be appropriate for any individual presenting in that manner to determine that the individual does not have an emergency medical condition [42 C.F.R. Section 489.24(c)].</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">As an example, CMS described a hypothetical case of an individual who presents to a dedicated emergency department seeking the removal of sutures. The analysis by CMS of  the hypothetical case noted that the patient visit implicated the EMTALA obligations since the individual came to a dedicated emergency department seeking examination and treatment  for a medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">CMS indicated that the hospital may have an emergency nurse, who has been designated  by the hospital and medical staff as a qualified professional to perform an MSE, conduct the MSE examination by obtaining the individual’s history, examining the sutures and determining whether the wound is healing appropriately. If the nurse concludes that the patient does not have an EMC, CMS stated that the EMTALA obligations would be satisfied.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In the preamble to the final regulations, CMS noted, however, that if it is later found that the individual who requested the removal of sutures in fact had an EMC, the extent and quality of the MSE by the nurse would be subject to review to determine whether the MSE was adequate [68 Fed.

As applied to a pregnant woman having contractions, the EMTALA regulations define an “emergency medical condition” as a condition in which there is inadequate time to effect a safe transfer to another hospital before delivery, or when a transfer may pose a threat to the health and safety of the woman or the unborn child. The regulations define “stabilized” as the delivery of the child and placenta.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">If a woman is in labor, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> require that the hospital must deliver the infant or transfer the patient in an appropriate manner:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">She may not be transferred unless she, or a legally responsible person acting on her behalf, requests a transfer and a physician or other qualified medical personnel, in consultation with a physician, certifies that the benefits to the condition of the woman and/or the unborn child outweigh the risks associated with the transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The transfer of a woman in labor is case-specific, and a high priority for EMTALA  enforcement. Therefore, CMS will review the woman’s prenatal history, her condition at the time of presentation to the hospital, the condition of the unborn child at the time of transfer or discharge, the respective capabilities of the transferring and receiving facilities, the expected delivery time and the means of transport. If the hospital discharges a woman having contractions (other than a certified false labor), CMS will closely scrutinize the condition of the woman and her unborn child, the reliability of her support systems and transportation to return to the hospital, and the actions of hospital staff.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">It is recommended that a hospital adopt policies and procedures describing the conditions and written instructions under which a woman having contractions may be sent home, or referred or transferred to another facility. The policies should also designate who may perform the screening and discharge or transfer of the patient, the need for physician consultation  and requirements for countersigning (if applicable) determinations of false labor. Additionally, hospitals should implement quality improvement and risk management reviews of discharges and transfers of women having contractions.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-6">42 C.F.R.

Managed care plans provide coverage for emergency services, but often place limits on services or restrict payment for emergency services. These colliding imperatives have resulted in efforts by the federal and state governments to increase access to emergency services by patients covered by <a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a>managed care plans, place limits on the ability of health plans to require prior authorization or control the provision of emergency services, and sanction hospitals for treating managed care patients in any manner different from other emergency patients.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Under the EMTALA regulations, a hospital may not delay providing a medical screening examination (MSE) or other emergency services in order to inquire about an individual’s method of payment or insurance status. In 1999, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) published a Special Advisory Bulletin (see Appendix H) to address the application of the EMTALA obligations to the provision of emergency services to managed care patients. In the 2003 revised EMTALA regulations, CMS adopted guidance set forth in the Special Advisory Bulletin prohibiting hospitals from seeking prior authorization for screening or stabilization services until the hospital has provided the MSE and initiated further examination and stabilizing treatment.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The primacy of EMTALA over managed care is emphasized in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-2">If an individual seeking care is a member of a managed care plan…the hospital is obligated to comply with the requirements of [EMTALA] regardless of the individual’s payor source or financial status. The hospitals [sic] is obligated to provide the services necessary to determine if an [emergency medical condition] is present and provide stabilizing treatment if indicated. This is true regardless if the individual is enrolled in a managed care plan that restricts the enrollee’s choice of health care provider. EMTALA is a requirement imposed  on hospitals, and the fact that an individual who comes to the hospital is enrolled in a managed care plan that does not contract with that hospital has no bearing on the obligation of the hospital to conduct an MSE and to at lease [sic] initiate stabilizing treatment. A managed health care plan may only state the services for which it will pay or decline payment, but that does not excuse the hospital from compliance with EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">In 2013, CMS issued a Survey and Certification letter (Appendix X) that reinforced the requirement for all Medicare-participating hospitals and critical access hospitals to comply with EMTALA, regardless of any conflicting requirements of third-party payors.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Some states have adopted laws providing for access to emergency services. For example, California law requires that emergency services must be provided without first questioning a patient’s ability to pay. California has also adopted several laws related to managed care and emergency services, including post-stabilization services.</p></li>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor003"></a>Questions<ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"></a> When can a hospital request information on a patient’s financial or insurance status?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The federal EMTALA and state laws on financial and insurance inquiries for emergency patients are not the same. The EMTALA regulations preclude delays in emergency services to make financial or insurance inquiries, and prohibit actions that discourage patients from remaining for further evaluation or treatment. California law is more restrictive, requiring that emergency services be provided without first questioning the patient’s ability to pay. As discussed below, CMS has warned hospitals that aggressive financial registration practices, including collection of money before examination or treatment, may result in EMTALA sanctions.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>EMTALA Requirements</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">As noted above, the EMTALA regulations provide that a hospital may not delay providing a MSE or other emergency services in order to inquire about an individual’s method of payment or insurance status. In 2003, CMS amended the regulations to clarify that a hospital may follow reasonable registration processes for patients covered by EMTALA. Patient registration may include requests for basic demographic information (such as name, address and other pertinent nonfinancial information). It may also include requests for insurance status and plan membership, as long as the inquiry does not delay the medical screening or treatment.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">CMS and the OIG historically have emphasized that inquiries or use of insurance or economic information that delay the provision of an MSE or necessary stabilizing treatment are  prohibited under EMTALA. As stated in the EMTALA regulations, “Reasonable registration processes may not unduly discourage individuals from remaining for further evaluation.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In addition, the 1999 Special Advisory Bulletin recommends that, prior to performing the MSE or commencing stabilized treatment, a hospital should not ask a patient to complete financial responsibility or Advance Beneficiary Notice of Noncoverage (ABN) forms or ask patients for co-payments for services (see Appendix H).</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">As discussed below, the EMTALA regulations were amended in 2003 to incorporate prior CMS guidance that a hospital may not seek prior authorization before the MSE or commencement of stabilizing treatment for an emergency medical condition (EMC). Although a managed care plan may inform the hospital, physician or the patient that coverage will not be provided, the denial of coverage does not affect a hospital’s obligations under EMTALA to screen the patient and provide necessary stabilizing treatment for an EMC.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In May 2012, CMS notified the major hospital associations of its concern with respect to “aggressive debt collection activities” that may have occurred in some hospitals. The CMS letter cited a specific allegation that a hospital may have tried to collect money from emergency patients before they were examined or received necessary treatments. The letter also stated:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">We would have serious concerns with the legality of any hospital policy or procedure that may discourage individuals from seeking emergency care, such as demanding that emergency department patients pay before receiving treatment. Our priority must be to ensure that hospitals do not delay screening exams or stabilizing treatment for patients in order to inquire about an individual’s method of payment or insurance status. (Letter dated May 9, 2012, from Marilyn Tavenner, Interim Administrator of CMS.)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In a subsequent EMTALA survey, CMS cited a hospital for failing to use a reasonable registration process. The survey report included an allegation that patients were asked to  pay copayments, co-insurance or past due amounts during the same time that they were still receiving medical screening and treatment services. The report also stated that patients were advised of the cost of care that had already been incurred prior to completion of services, which resulted in one patient declining a recommended overnight admission to the hospital  for further monitoring and observation of her condition. Several of the allegations were also  the subject of a separate survey under the Medicare Conditions of Participation for patient rights.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In December 2013, CMS issued Survey and Certification Memorandum 14-06: EMTALA Requirements &amp; Conflicting Payor Requirements or Collection Practices (Dec. 13, 2013) (Appendix X) in response to the hospital debt collection activities it was observing. The guidance reiterated that “[a] request to an individual to make immediate payment for services required under EMTALA while such required services are being provided does not fall under either of the permitted exceptions” to the general prohibition on inquiring about method of payment or insurance status. CMS also reinforced the idea that</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">“[a] request by the hospital for immediate payment by an individual who is protected under EMTALA goes well beyond a mere inquiry about payment method.

This guidance was subsequently codified in the EMTALA regulations:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">An emergency physician or nonphysician practitioner is not precluded from contacting the individual’s physician at any time to seek advice regarding the individual’s medical history and needs that may be relevant to the medical treatment and screening of the patient, as long as this consultation does not inappropriately delay services required under paragraph (a) [medical screening] and paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) [stabilization, transfer or inpatient admission].</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">It should be noted that the broad language in the regulation suggests that the emergency physician should be able to contact any physician who can provide clinical information that will assist in providing emergency services to the patient.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In its 2013 guidance (Appendix X), CMS noted its concern with payors requiring a secondary evaluation and approval before an individual with an EMC is admitted as an inpatient or transferred to another facility, including payors directing that individuals are transferred to a specific facility. If the individual’s condition is not stabilized, payor intervention in an admission or transfer decision could place the hospital at risk for an EMTALA violation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Hospitals should expect that CMS and OIG will closely scrutinize discussions with a patient’s physician (especially a gatekeeper or other managed care physician) to determine whether they are clinical or financial in nature. If an off-site physician provides necessary clinical information and other assistance to the treating physician, those discussions will be viewed  as enhancing the quality or continuity of medical services, and therefore will not result in an EMTALA violation.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">On the other hand, if the off-site physician attempts to limit or deny necessary emergency services for the patient or influence the treating physician to transfer or discharge the patient, CMS or OIG may later take the position that any subsequent action taken by the hospital or the treating physician to discharge the patient was tainted by the directions of  the off-site physician. As noted in footnote 4 of the Special Advisory Bulletin, if the managed care physician requests that the patient be transferred, the treating physician must provide medical screening and necessary stabilizing treatment, and if the patient is not stable, effectuate an appropriate transfer only if there is a medical necessity or an informed patient request for the transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">As discussed below, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> and the Medicare Advantage regulations provide that the judgment of the treating physician takes precedence over the judgment of an off-site physician or the patient’s health plan.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip _idGenParaOverride-7"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> Hospitals should conduct in-service education for emergency physicians, nurses and other staff who may contact attending staff or managed care plans in the course of an emergency visit.

This staff member also should be knowledgeable about the hospital’s anti-dumping statute obligations and should clearly inform the patient that, notwithstanding the patient’s ability to pay, the hospital stands ready and willing to provide a medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment, if necessary. Hospital staff should encourage any patient who believes that he or she may have an emergency medical condition to remain for the medical screening examination and any necessary stabilizing treatment. Staff should also encourage the patient to defer further discussion of financial responsibility issues if possible, until <span class="CharOverride-3">after</span> the medical screening has been performed. (Emphasis in original.)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">If a patient asks the hospital if it accepts his or her health plan, the hospital should respond  to the patient. If the patient is not a member of a health plan that contracts with the hospital, the hospital should reaffirm (and document) its offer to provide a MSE, and it should take reasonable steps to encourage the patient to remain for the examination. A number of hospitals have been cited by CMS or OIG for EMTALA violations when a patient leaves the hospital prior to the MSE after learning that the facility does not contract with his or her health plan.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip _idGenParaOverride-7"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> In order to respond to the presumption usually held by the enforcement agencies that the patient left or was turned away for financial reasons, hospital staff should document any information that they have regarding financial or health plan discussions with the patient, the offer to provide the MSE and the reasons for the patient leaving the facility.

Although the Special Advisory Bulletin did not specifically address collection of co-payments prior to medical screening, it advised that a “best practice” was not to obtain an individual’s agreement for payment before stabilization. This suggests that co-payments should not be solicited or collected from the patient before the MSE has been completed.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">If a patient offers a co-payment and insists that he or she does not want to defer its collection until after emergency services are rendered, then registration should note that the patient voluntarily offered the co-payment.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 ParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker006"></a>When should <a id="_idIndexMarker007"></a>Advance Beneficiary Notices be given to patients seeking emergency services?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-8">An Advance Beneficiary Notice of Noncoverage (ABN) is a Medicare-required written notice (CMS R-131) to a Medicare beneficiary that payment for services from a hospital or physician may be denied.

As explained by CMS in a prior posting on the Medicare Learning Network:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-9">The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has engaged physicians and their professional organizations in conversations surrounding the perceived conflict between EMTALA requirements and Advance Beneficiary Notice (ABN) instructions. Other than possible problems due to coding conventions … this problem seems to be more one of confusion than of real conflict. EMTALA  does not prohibit asking payment questions entirely, rather, only doing so before screening/stabilization. After screening/stabilization, EMTALA no longer applies and ABNs may be given. Under CMS policy, an ABN should not be given to any patient under great duress, which includes patients seeking emergency services before they are stabilized. Nothing in CMS policy prohibits giving ABNs, when otherwise appropriate, to patients who come to emergency care settings after they have received a medical screening examination and are stabilized.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"></a>What are the Knox-Keene requirements for emergency services?<span class="CharOverride-4"><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap4_rebuild.html#footnote-000">1</a></span></span><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idIndexMarker008"></a>In California, the Knox-Keene Act governs the licensing of managed care plans.

										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Under the Knox-Keene Act, a health plan or an independent practice association (IPA) may not require a hospital to obtain authorization prior to providing emergency services and care. Health plans and IPAs may require a hospital to obtain prior authorization for care provided after the patient is stabilized.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"></a>Prior Authorization for <a id="_idIndexMarker011"></a>Post-Stabilization Services</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">A health plan or IPA that requires prior authorization must provide 24-hour access for enrollees and providers to obtain timely authorization for medically necessary care to be provided to an enrollee who has received emergency services and is stabilized, but the treating provider believes the patient may not be transferred or discharged safely. If the prior authorization requirement involves a determination of whether the post-stabilization services are medically necessary, a request for authorization must be reviewed and processed in accordance with written criteria and guidelines that are supported by clinical principles and processes.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">A decision to approve or deny authorization must be made in a timely fashion, in light of the enrollee’s medical condition. For example, decisions must be made within five business days in all cases, or within 72 hours if the enrollee faces an imminent and serious threat to his or her health. Generally, a timely decision for a patient who is stable for transfer but requires an inpatient admission or transfer to a higher level of care for follow-up care should be shorter (perhaps hours), depending on the circumstances.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The plan must make a physician available for consultation and resolving disputed requests  for authorization. These requirements do not apply to a health plan that does not require prior   authorization as a prerequisite for payment of necessary medical care following stabilization  of an EMC. Existing regulations require the plan to respond to the provider’s request for authorization to provide post-stabilization care within 30 minutes of the request. The failure of a health plan to meet this requirement is deemed to constitute authorization for the follow-up medical care to the patient.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"></a>Request for Post-Stabilization Services</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text"><span class="All-Caps-Bold">Note:</span> The following discussion applies only to post-stabilization services that are provided by a noncontracting hospital to a patient who is a member of a health plan that requires authorization for post-stabilization services and maintains 24-hour access for patients and providers (including noncontracting hospitals) to obtain timely authorization for medically necessary post-stabilization services. This discussion does not apply to emergency services provided to a patient who is still covered by the EMTALA obligations (i.e., the patient has an EMC that is not stabilized).</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Pursuant to revisions to the California hospital licensing laws effective Jan. 1, 2009, if a patient with an EMC who is a member of a health plan that requires prior authorization for post-stabilization services (i.e., medically necessary care provided after the patient’s EMC is stabilized) presents to a noncontracting hospital, the hospital, with the exception of certain minor procedures described below, must do all of the following before initiating post- stablization services:</p>
										<ol>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-4">Seek to obtain the name and contact information of the health plan. The efforts to obtain this information must be documented in the patient medical record, including:<ol><li class="Body-Styles_Alpha-list _idGenParaOverride-11">Requesting the patient for his/her health plan member card;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Alpha-list _idGenParaOverride-11">Asking the patient, family member or other person accompanying the patient to identify the plan; or</li><li class="Body-Styles_Alpha-list _idGenParaOverride-11">Taking other means known to the hospital for accurately identifying the patient’s plan; and</li></ol></li>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">If the health plan has been identified, contacting the health plan or the plan’s contracting medical provider (such as an IPA). The contact must be made in accordance with instructions on the patient’s health plan member card or using information provided by the health plan (as described below). The hospital is not required to make more than one telephone call to the plan or contracting medical provider, so long as the health plan or contracting medical provider can reach a representative of the hospital upon returning the call. The person calling the health plan or a contracting medical provider is not required to be a physician;</li>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Upon a request of the health plan or its contracting medical provider, the hospital must provide the diagnosis and other relevant information reasonably necessary for the plan or medical provider to make a decision to authorize post-stabilization care or assume the management of the patient’s care by arranging a prompt transfer to another hospital.</li>
										</ol>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Authorization is not required for minor treatment procedures in the following circumstances:</p>
										<ol>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-4">The procedure is provided within the emergency department;</li>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The procedure concludes the treatment of the presenting EMC and is related to that condition, even though the treatment may not resolve the underlying medical condition;</li>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The procedure is performed according to accepted standards of practice; and</li>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">The procedure would result in the direct discharge or release of the patient from the emergency department following receiving the procedure.</li>
										</ol>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The health plan, or its contracting medical provider, that is contacted by a noncontracting hospital to obtain authorization for post-stabilization services must, within 30 minutes from the time of the initial contact, either:</p>
										<ol>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-4">Authorize post-stabilization services, or</li>
											<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Inform the hospital that it will arrange for the prompt transfer of the patient to another hospital.</li>

										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If the health plan or its contracting medical provider authorizes post-stabilization services, the hospital must request the patient’s medical record from the health plan or contracting medical provider. The health plan or contracting medical provider, after conferring with  the noncontracting hospital, must transmit appropriate portions of the patient record (if in possession of the plan) by fax or electronic mail, as may be requested by the noncontracting hospital or treating physician and consistent with applicable laws protecting patient privacy.</p>

										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If the health plan or its contracting medical provider notifies the noncontracting hospital that it will arrange the transfer, the health plan or contracting medical provider must make all of the arrangements for the transfer, including finding an accepting facility.

										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"></a>Independent Medical Review</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">An enrollee may request the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) to provide an independent medical review of a health plan’s or IPA’s denial of a claim for urgent or emergency services based in whole or in part on the lack of medical necessity.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As a condition of seeking the review, the enrollee must first give the health plan 30 days to resolve the grievance, or three days to do so if the services have not yet been provided and the enrollee faces an imminent and serious threat to his or her health (such as severe pain, potential loss of life, limb or major bodily function). Hospitals and other providers are not authorized to initiate the independent medical review process, but they may join with or assist the enrollee in pursuing medical review and may act as the enrollee’s advocate.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"></a>Strategies for Obtaining Authorization and Payment</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Although there are no surefire methods to ensure that hospitals and physicians receive authorization an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r payment in a timely manner for rendering post-stabilization care, the following measures are suggested.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Reinforce Member Responsibility</span></p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Hospitals should review their admission practices and forms to ensure that they obtain an appropriate acknowledgment and agreement of financial responsibility for each patient. If the hospital does not contract with the patient’s health plan, the acknowledgment should include the patient’s agreement to accept financial liability for the hospital charges that the health plan or IPA refuses to pay. If the hospital contracts with the patient’s health plan, the plan contract will address the circumstances in which the patient is responsible for the hospital’s charges. In most cases, the patient should acknowledge that he or she will pay for services that the health plan or IPA refuses to authorize, but which the patient requests be provided, as well as emergency services if the health plan or IPA later determines that the enrollee did not have an EMC.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Pursue Member Responsibility</span></p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The Knox-Keene Act contains more provisions protecting enrollees than provisions protecting providers. The DMHC does not have the power to resolve disputes between providers and plans (e.g., to order a health plan to pay a particular claim). However, the DMHC has the power to review and resolve grievances made by enrollees.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Moreover, if the grievance pertains to a denial based on medical necessity, the DMHC has the final authority to resolve the grievance. In consideration of hospital billing and collection practices, noncontracting hospitals may in some instances be able to pursue a health plan enrollee under his or her acknowledgment of financial responsibility in order to encourage the enrollee to submit a grievance to the health plan an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r the DMHC. Once a grievance is initiated, the hospital may participate in the grievance review an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r independent medical review process.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Make Timely Requests for </span><span class="Bold"><a id="_idIndexMarker015"></a></span><span class="Bold">Prior Authorization</span></p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Hospitals should review their internal procedures for determining the need for prior authorization, and then seek any necessary authorization at the appropriate time during the patient’s course of treatment. If a patient presents to the hospital with an EMC, emergency services and care may be provided without authorization; however, authorization should be obtained before proceeding with post- stabilization care. If a patient is determined by the MSE not to have an EMC, then authorization should be obtained prior to proceeding to provide follow-up care for the patient (unless the patient’s condition destabilizes before authorization is obtained).</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Patient is Unstable for Transfer</span></p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If a receiving hospital is requested to accept the transfer of an emergency health plan patient who has an EMC that is not stabilized and needs a higher level of care, the hospital should accept the patient if it has the capacity and capability to provide the services. The hospital should confirm the patient’s unstable condition with the transferring hospital or physician, and make sure that it obtains a copy of the physician’s certification for the transfer. Following the admission of the patient at the receiving hospital, the hospital should seek authorization for services that will be required for the patient after he or she is stabilized. If the health plan or IPA fails or refuses to give an authorization for post- stabilization services, the hospital should request that the plan assume responsibility for the patient’s continuing post-stabilization care (which may involve a further transfer to a plan-contracting hospital). As long as the patient is unstable, the hospital should continue to provide stabilizing treatment for the patient, and should not transfer the patient except as the result of an informed request by the patient, medical necessity or other valid clinical reasons.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Patient’s Condition is Stabilized for Transfer</span></p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If a receiving hospital is requested to accept the transfer of a health plan patient whose EMC is stabilized, but the patient needs post-stabilization services at a facility providing a higher level of care, the receiving hospital is not obligated to accept the transfer unless it has a legal or contractual obligation to do so (see chapter 7, “Obligations of Receiving Hospitals”). The hospital should confirm with the transferring hospital or physician that the patient’s EMC is stabilized. The hospital may then advise the transferring hospital that is willing to admit and treat the patient, subject to obtaining prior authorization for the post-stabilization services.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Consistent with its EMTALA obligations, the receiving hospital should inform the transferring hospital that, if the patient’s condition destabilizes while it is seeking prior authorization, the transferring hospital should immediately call the receiving hospital to arrange for the transfer without waiting for the authorization to be received. Assuming that the patient’s condition remains stabilized and authorization is obtained, the hospital may accept the transfer and provide the authorized services to the patient. If the patient later requires services that exceed the scope of the authorization, the hospital should follow the process discussed above for obtaining further authorization or request that the health plan or IPA assume responsibility for providing the additional treatment required for the patient.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Require Health Plans and IPAs to Assume Responsibility</span></p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">As discussed above, if a health plan or IPA does not grant authorization for post-stabilization services within a reasonable period of time, the hospital should request (or if necessary, demand) that the health plan or IPA assume responsibility for the enrollee’s plan (such as arranging for a transfer if medically appropriate).</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Pursue Dispute Resolution Opportunities</span></p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">To the extent feasible and prudent, a hospital should submit inappropriate denials to the health plan’s dispute resolution process.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Pursue Contract Remedies</span></p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Hospitals that contract with a health plan that has denied authorization or payment should review its contract with the plan to determine its contractual remedies that are in addition to its legal remedies.</p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Header-4"><span class="Bold">Report Unfair Payment Patterns to DMHC</span></p>
										<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Health plans are prohibited from engaging in “unfair payment patterns.” If a hospital believes that a health plan is engaged in a “demonstrable and unjust pattern…of…denying complete and accurate claims” within a reasonable time, the hospital may report the unfair payment pattern to the DMHC Office of Plan and Provider Relations. The Office may be contacted at 877-525-1295 or providers@dmhc.ca.gov. Although the DMHC cannot order payment to a provider, it can impose administrative sanctions on the health plan.</p>

If the hospital does not have the capability to provide necessary stabilizing treatment, or upon an informed request by the patient, the hospital must make an appropriate transfer of the patient to another facility. In addition, if a hospital has exhausted its capability or is operating beyond its capacity, an appropriate transfer must be made if the EMC is not stabilized.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">An emergency patient who has an unstabilized EMC may be transferred only if one of two conditions is present:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">The patient makes an informed request for the transfer; or</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker000"></a>The transfer is for medical reasons and the transferring physician certifies that  the medical benefits reasonably expected from treatment at the receiving facility outweigh the increased risks to the patient from the transfer.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">An appropriate transfer of a patient with an <a id="_idIndexMarker001"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker002"></a>unstabilized EMC must meet four basic criteria:</p><ol>

If a patient has an EMC that has not been “stabilized,” a hospital may not transfer the patient unless either there is an informed patient request or a physician certification for the transfer, and the transfer is implemented in accordance with EMTALA standards that are addressed in <a href="EMTALA_Chap5_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor011" data-href="_idTextAnchor011">III.&nbsp;“Standards for Appropriate Transfer,” </a>.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"></a>When is an emergency medical condition considered to be “stabilized?” <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The term “stabilized” is one of the most important and most misunderstood words in the EMTALA statute and regulations. An understanding of the meaning of “stabilized” is critical since it determines:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">When a hospital has met its EMTALA obligations to a patient who has an EMC;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">When a hospital must follow the EMTALA standards for making an appropriate transfer of a patient; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">When a receiving hospital must accept, or may refuse to accept, a transfer of a patient with an EMC from another hospital.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Under the EMTALA regulations, <span class="Bold">“stabilized”</span> means, with respect to an EMC, that no    material deterioration of the patient’s condition is likely, with reasonable medical probability, to result from or occur during the transfer or discharge of the patient from the facility, or that a woman has delivered her child and the placenta. The same definition is also used in California law.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Unfortunately, physicians often use the terms “stabilized” and “stable” interchangeably, which may not always be correct. This sometimes results in confusion on the part of staff at the transferring and receiving facilities regarding when a patient has an EMC that is “stabilized” within the meaning of EMTALA.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"></a>If a patient is determined to be “stable,” does that mean that the EMC is stabilized?<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">As used by EMTALA, the term “stabilized” has a meaning that differs from the common   use by physicians of the term “stable.” In the St. Anthony Hospital decision <span class="Italic">(see chapter 7, “Obligations of Receiving Hospitals”)</span>, the court noted that the legal definition of “stabilization” in EMTALA is different from the medical use of the term “stable” to denote the status of a patient or hi<span class="No-break">s/h</span>er condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The concern regarding the use of the medical term “stable” is illustrated in a 2013 Survey and Certification Letter issued by CMS (Appendix X). In the letter, CMS cautioned hospitals that  “the statutory definition of an individual’s EMC being ‘stabilized’ does not necessarily equate   to an individual being clinically stable.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-6">The similarity of the terms “clinically stable” and “stabilized” appears to cause confusion among hospitals, practitioners and other hospital staff. It is not uncommon for practitioners to find that an individual has become “clinically stable,” often understood to mean the normalization of the individual’s vital signs, and then conclude that the hospital’s EMTALA obligation has ended. However, if the EMC has not been stabilized, as that term is defined … [by   the EMTALA regulations], EMTALA continues to apply. For example, a patient diagnosed with appendicitis might have relatively normal vital signs, but is still  in need of surgery, and therefore continues to have an EMC that has not been stabilized.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-6">Furthermore, many practitioners and some third-party payors seem to assume that if an individual can withstand the risk of a transfer, then that means the individual has been stabilized and the hospital’s EMTALA obligation has ended. This also is not necessarily the case. This mistaken assumption can be reflected in the commonly used term “stable for transfer.” “Stable for transfer”  is not a term used in EMTALA, and it is not necessarily equivalent to the term “stabilized,” as defined for EMTALA purposes. Use of this term can, therefore, be very misleading.

The revisions to the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> stated that a patient’s EMC is deemed stabilized if the treating physician (or other qualified professional) determines within reasonable clinical confidence that the patient’s EMC has been “resolved.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The term “resolved” does not appear in the EMTALA statute or regulations, and is not defined by CMS in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>. As part of clarifying the meaning of “resolved,” CMS stated that patient stabilization does not require the resolution of the underlying medical condition. As an example, CMS describes a patient with an asthma attack who requires treatment under EMTALA to alleviate the acute respiratory symptoms. After the immediate EMC is resolved, the hospital may discharge the patient, admit the patient or transfer the patient depending on his or her needs (noting that the transfer is not covered by EMTALA because the EMC was resolved). CMS notes that this guidance is a clarification, rather than a change, of policy.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> warn that if there is a dispute between CMS (or a surveyor) as to whether an individual’s EMC is stabilized (or resolved), the burden of proof is the responsibility of the transferring hospital. Surveyors are directed to assess patient stability and refer appropriate cases to the quality improvement organization (QIO) for review.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Despite the effort to develop a clearer meaning of the term “stabilized” or the implications of the term “resolved,” the best guidance offered by CMS is as follows:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-6">If the treating physician is in doubt that an individual’s EMC is stabilized the physician should implement an appropriate transfer … to prevent a potential violation of EMTALA, if his/her hospital cannot provide further stabilizing treatment.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>	References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-7">42 C.F.R.

Since CMS has not adopted separate standards for psychiatric EMCs, the definition of “stabilized” for medical emergencies (i.e., no material deterioration of the condition is likely,  with reasonable medical probability, to result from or occur during the transfer or discharge of  a patient from a facility) also applies to whether a psychiatric EMC is stabilized.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">It is important to keep in mind that there is no distinction under the EMTALA rules between the transfer of an individual with a medical EMC or an individual with a psychiatric EMC. In 2016, OIG settled with Research Medical Center (RMC) of Missouri for $360,000 to resolve RMC’s:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Failure to provide an adequate MSE and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Making an improper transfer of a patient with a psychiatric EMC.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The patient arrived at RMC’s ED and, without providing stabilizing treatment, RMC transported the patient to a nearby facility by private vehicle. During transport, the patient exited the vehicle and was struck by another vehicle. In the course of its investigation, OIG found 17 additional occasions where RMC failed to provide adequate MSEs and improperly transferred or discharged patients with psychiatric EMCs, without providing stabilizing treatment.

Therefore, in the event of a disagreement between the treating physician and an off-site physician, the medical judgment of the treating physician will usually take precedence over that of the off-site physician.

A number of hospitals have been cited by CMS, and settled civil money penalty claims with the Office of Inspector General (OIG), for failing to assess a patient at the time of transfer, especially in cases when there was a delay between the order for transfer and the departure of the patient. In cases where the patient’s condition deteriorates during the transfer or upon arrival at the receiving facility, CMS and OIG will look closely at the patient’s ongoing monitoring and care provided immediately prior to the patient’s discharge to determine whether the patient’s condition was stabilized for the transfer.

Can a transfer be hospital to an emergency department?</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">With respect to the first question, the EMTALA statute and regulations, in prescribing the standards for an appropriate transfer, do not refer to the receiving facility as a “hospital.” Rather, the statute and regulations refer to the receiving facility more simply as a “medical facility.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The use of the term “facility” rather than “hospital” suggests that EMTALA permits a hospital  to transfer an EMTALA patient (i.e., an individual with an EMC) to a facility that is not a licensed hospital so long as the receiving facility has the capability and capacity to stabilize  the EMC. As pertinent to psychiatric emergency patients, the reference to a “medical facility” could be interpreted to permit hospitals to transfer an EMTALA patient to a psychiatric health facility (PHF) or a crisis stabilization unit (CSU) even if they are not considered to be “hospitals.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In November 2009, CMS Baltimore headquarters, in a letter to the author of this manual, indicated that there are circumstances in which a hospital could transfer an EMTALA patient with a psychiatric EMC to a CSU. The circumstances and conditions under which an EMTALA transfer could be made to a CSU are discussed in chapter 6.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The response to the second question, transfer from ED to ED, is within the discretion of the receiving hospital. While a transferring physician may request admission of a patient to a specific bed unit or department, the receiving hospital may route the patient through its ED or other bed unit or department based on clinical considerations. This is also addressed under <a href="">L.&nbsp;“Are transfers considered to be emergency department to emergency department?,” page&nbsp;7.10</a>.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"></a>Standards for Transfer of a Patient with an Aerosol Transmissible Disease <p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text"><a id="_idIndexMarker011"></a>Under a regulation adopted in 2009 by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Ca<span class="No-break">l/O</span>SHA), hospitals must follow specific standards for transferring patients who  have, or are suspected to have, an airborne infectious disease (AirID)<span class="CharOverride-3"><span id="footnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap5_rebuild.html#footnote-002" data-href="footnote-002">3</a></span></span>. The regulation defines “AirID” as either:</p><ol>

If the receiving hospital has established a transfer center or a central number for processing requests for transfers, the sending hospital should call the transfer center or other centralized unit for handling transfers.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">Do not call the receiving hospital emergency department and ask for the name and telephone number of an on-call physician before you have talked with staff  at the receiving hospital. Under EMTALA, transfers are hospital-to-hospital, and the receiving hospital should be able to assess its bed and service capacity and capability before contacting an on-call physician. Calling the on-call physician before talking with the hospital may delay the transfer. In addition, the accepting physician may not be aware of the receiving hospital’s capacity, which could result in a patient arriving for stabilizing services that are not available.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2"><a id="_idIndexMarker013"></a>Have pertinent portions of the medical record available to provide orally,  electronically or in hard copy to the receiving hospital. If the receiving hospital requests portions of the medical record in order to evaluate whether it can meet the needs of a patient with an unstabilized EMC, give or send only clinical information (not financial information). If the time necessary to fax or transmit the record may jeopardize the condition of the patient, advise the receiving hospital that the delay    to send the records may result in further deterioration of the patient’s condition.</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">If the patient’s EMC is not stabilized (i.e., an EMTALA transfer), do not discuss the patient’s financial status or insurance information with the receiving hospital or physician.

The use of personal vehicles to transfer a patient whose condition is not stabilized or resolved is not expressly prohibited under EMTALA; however, it is clearly disfavored and CMS will closely scrutinize  the reasons why personal transportation was used.

In general, EMTALA focuses on the capability and capacity of the hospital as   a whole, rather than the capability of the dedicated emergency department. For example, if a hospital provides obstetric services, the staff and resources of the obstetric service must be considered available to screen and treat a woman in labor who comes to the hospital.</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"></a>Capability to Provide Services<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">EMTALA compliance is more difficult if a hospital does not have an organized service or medical specialty to treat the needs of a particular emergency patient. CMS will determine on a case-by-case basis whether a hospital has the capability to provide a service even if the hospital is not licensed to offer that service. For example, in the preamble to the 1994 EMTALA regulations, CMS stated that a hospital that does not offer perinatal services may not transfer a woman having contractions if the hospital has the staff and facilities to perform an uncomplicated delivery. In a 2017 settlement, the OIG determined that a South Carolina hospital that maintained a “voluntary” psychiatric unit allegedly violated EMTALA by not providing psychiatric examination and treatment in the ED, and maintained “involuntary” psychiatric patients in the ED for “days and weeks” instead of admitting the patients to its voluntary psychiatric unit for stabilizing treatment. Further details of this case are discussed in chapter 6 of this manual.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"></a>Capacity to Provide Services<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The EMTALA regulations define <span class="Bold">“capacity”</span> as the ability to admit or treat patients (e.g., staff, beds and equipment) as well as the “hospital’s past practices of accommodating additional patients in excess of its occupancy limits.” As noted in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, if “a   hospital has customarily accommodated patients in excess of its occupancy limits … it has,   in fact, demonstrated the ability to provide services to patients in excess of its occupancy limits.” CMS will look at the hospital’s history of absorbing emergency patients by shifting patient room assignments or calling in additional staff. If a hospital has provided services to emergency patients in excess of its service capacity, CMS may allege an EMTALA violation if the hospital denies treatment to a similar patient with an EMC.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"></a>Capacity and Nurse Staffing Ratios<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idIndexMarker019"></a>The nurse staffing standards in California place a hospital in a Catch-22 situation when it has available beds but does not meet the staffing ratios at the time of an emergency admission. Does a hospital have “capacity” within the meaning of EMTALA to admit a critically ill  individual with an unresolved EMC if the admitting unit will not meet the staffing ratios; or, should (or must) the patient be transferred?</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In 2004, the Licensing and Certification Division of CDPH issued guidance in responding to “health care emergencies,” which it defined as temporary overcrowding and saturation due  to a rapid influx of patients. In a Jan. 9, 2004 memorandum to hospitals (AFL 04-01), CDPH stated the following:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-6">Hospitals are <span class="Bold">not required to seek prior approval from [CDPH], L&amp;C   to decrease staffing levels below required ratios during a healthcare emergency</span>. Hospitals are expected to respond immediately to emergency situations in the most effective manner to ensure the health and safety of their patients. They will not be found in violation of the nurse-to-patient ratio regulations during a healthcare emergency, provided they can demonstrate they took appropriate steps to try to maintain required staffing levels. (emphasis in original)</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">CDPH has also noted that observation beds in a licensed emergency department are not counted in a hospital’s licensed bed capacity. According to CDPH, “hospitals are expected   to meet their obligations under state and federal laws to provide emergency services without regard to any requests to increase patient accommodations.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">CDPH has not issued additional advice on how it would interpret and enforce the staffing ratios with respect to an individual emergency admission or transfer when there is no saturation or overcrowding. In the absence of guidance, the hospital must decide whether to admit the patient (and possibly violate the nurse staffing ratios) or make an appropriate transfer of the patient to another hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">If the hospital admits the patient when it is out of compliance with staffing ratios, a surveyor may later cite the hospital under state law, which may subject the facility to fines or other sanctions under state and federal laws, as well as litigation by the patient if there is an adverse outcome. If the hospital transfers the patient, a surveyor may later review the admission patterns at the time of the transfer (were other patients admitted or transferred?) and the historical practices of the hospital in admitting or transferring patients in similar situations. The survey could result in an EMTALA violation, as well as potential litigation if there is an adverse outcome.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">CDPH has noted that hospital self-reporting for non-compliance with the staffing ratios is intended to apply only to “all occurrences that disrupt the operation of the facility,” including health care emergencies that result in a failure to meet the staffing ratios despite planning   for census fluctuations. Therefore, hospitals are not required to self-report all events that CDPH could cite as a violation. Self-reporting for an emergency admission (in the absence of a health care emergency) of a potential violation of the staffing ratios requires an evaluation    of the needs of the patient and other facts relating to the circumstances.

Rather, the requirements for the transfer are addressed in state law.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Under the California emergency services law, a transfer that is made for a “nonmedical reason” is subject to eight standards. The standards apply to a transfer of an ED patient   for economic reasons (i.e., inability to pay) or alignment of a patient with a contracting or in-network health plan facility. Some of the standards are similar to the EMTALA standards for an appropriate transfer of a patient with an unstabilized EMC; however, there are several additional standards including:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">A determination that the transfer will not create a “medical hazard” (this is defined in Health and Safety Code Section 1317.1(f), included as Appendix D);</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">An accepting physician has agreed to the transfer;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">The transfer documents include a “transfer summary” which is defined in the statute; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-2">The hospital has made and documented a reasonable attempt to notify a “preferred contact person” if known, or, if unknown, to ascertain a “preferred contact person”  or next of kin, before the transfer.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">These standards do not apply to transfers of a patient covered by EMTALA or transfers of a patient for medical reasons.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">These standards are addressed in Appendix D (Health and Safety Code Section 1317.2) and Chapter 12 of CHA’s Consent Manual, under the heading “Transfer of a Patient Without an Emergency Medical Condition.”</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-1"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"></a>Application of Emtala to Transfers for Off-Site Tests<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> provide that if a hospital transfers a patient who has or may  have an EMC to another hospital for a test (such as an MRI) with the intention that the patient return to the transferring facility after the test, the transferring hospital must effect  the transfer in accordance with EMTALA standards.

These laws have also been raised in other counties in California, but the enforcement actions in Los Angeles have received extensive publicity, including attention in a motion picture and by the national media.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-12">The media, the Los Angeles City Attorney, and various homeless advocates have focused considerable attention on the problem of an appropriate destination for discharged homeless patients. Concerns have been expressed that some hospitals may send discharged homeless patients to skid row areas of town so that those patients may stay in a shelter while further recuperating from their illness or injury. Some shelters have expressed the view that they are not staffed or equipped to handle a convalescing patient, especially a patient who requires follow-up care.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-12">This media and law enforcement attention has resulted in legislative and judicial efforts to change the procedures by which homeless patients are discharged from hospitals and to penalize hospitals for discharge decisions an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r for facilitating the transport of homeless patients to shelters or other destinations that cannot meet the needs of the patients.</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"></a>Federal Laws on Emergency Patient Discharge<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">As discussed above, the EMTALA <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> require that emergency patients who are discharged must receive a plan for appropriate follow-up, including information necessary to prevent a relapse or worsening of their medical conditions.

This law requires hospitals to have a   written discharge planning policy and process, which includes “appropriate arrangements for posthospital care … are made prior to discharge for those patients who are likely to suffer adverse health consequences for posthospital care.” These arrangements include care at a skilled nursing or intermediate care facility, hospice or at home.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Section 1262.5 clearly applies whether a patient is or is not homeless, although unlike   Section 1262.4, it does not impose specific standards for homeless patients.<span class="CharOverride-3"><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap5_rebuild.html#footnote-000" data-href="footnote-000">5</a></span></span> CDPH has not issued a formal interpretation as to whether the discharge planning requirements of Section 1262.5 apply to emergency patients (as well as other outpatients). The author’s view is that,   in the absence of CDPH guidance or a judicial interpretation of the statute, Section 1262.5 applies only to the discharge of inpatients, and conversely, does not apply to emergency patients. This view is based on the wording of the statute and the legislative history, which indicate an intent to codify in state law the Medicare Condition of Participation for discharge planning (which, as noted above, do not apply to emergency patients).</p></li><li class="Body-Styles_Header-2 _idGenParaOverride-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"></a>Litigation (City of Los Angeles)<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Beginning in December 2005, the Los Angeles City Attorney initiated enforcement efforts related to the transport of homeless patients to skid row. The initial effort involved a letter to several hospitals alerting them of possible legal action for their discharge practices involving homeless patients.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Since November 2006, the City Attorney has filed criminal and civil charges against several hospitals within and outside the City of Los Angeles for the practice of “homeless dumping.” The complaints generally allege that the hospitals discharged and transported to skid row homeless patients without a plan for post-hospital care or verifying that a place could    provide adequate shelter and recuperative care services. The complaints have included both criminal counts (such as false imprisonment and dependent adult endangerment), and civil complaints (such as unlawful and unfair business practices, including failure to follow state  law on discharge planning).</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In the complaints, the City Attorney has described “homeless dumping” as including the following elements:</p><ol><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Discharging homeless patients without proper clothing, sometimes no more than a hospital gown;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Discharging homeless patients on a gurney or wheelchair, with intravenous or other equipment attached to the patient;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Discharging homeless patients prematurely;</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Arranging for homeless patients to be transported considerable distances, often up to 15 to 30 miles, notwithstanding the availability of a closer shelter; and</li><li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List _idGenParaOverride-5">Transporting homeless patients to skid row without first checking to determine the availability of shelter beds or services necessary for the patients.</li></ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Since May 2007, the City Attorney has entered into several settlement agreements with hospitals that require the hospitals to develop a training program for hospital staff and a discharge protocol for all homeless patients (including emergency patients). The discharge protocol must be monitored by a third party who must approve the training program, review quarterly certifications of compliance and recommend contempt actions for violations of the settlement agreement. The settlement agreements also include funding of homeless services, fines and other costs.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Under the common form of the discharge protocol, the hospitals agree to the following practices for all homeless patients:</p><ol>
										<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-3">Record homeless patients on a homeless patient log.</li>
										<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Provide appropriate clothing at the time of discharge.</li>
										<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Assess patient “cognitive intactness,” including living conditions and support systems; complexity of the discharge plan; orientation to person, time and place; ability to provide self-care; and access to medical care, food and shelter.</li>
										<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Perform a needs assessment, including food and shelter, treatment for substance abuse or domestic violence, vocational assistance, Medicaid enrollment and eligibility for other public services.</li>
										<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Establish discharge plans that meet patient medical and social needs, with appropriate referrals and help with eligibility for Kaiser’s Financial Assistance Program to obtain drugs or equipment.</li>
										<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">For a post-discharge referral to a shelter, the hospital must locate available options, assure that the patient meets the shelter’s criteria for acceptance and document the consent of the patient and shelter to the placement.</li>
										<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">For a patient seeking transport to a skid row shelter, the hospital administrator (or designee) must approve the discharge plan.</li>
									</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The hospitals also agreed to implement an in-service program for physician, clinical, social service, discharge planning and other staff involved in the care and discharge of homeless patients. The training program included the requirements of the discharge protocol; homelessness in Los Angeles County; problems faced by homeless patients; assessment of cognitive intactness; post-discharge issues; communication with homeless patients; location of shelters and services for the homeless; referral sources; the hazards of skid row; and the use of surrogate decision makers for homeless patients.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In 2008, the authority of the Los Angeles City Attorney was reinforced by the enactment of an ordinance by the Los Angeles City Council applying to the transportation by all health facilities of discharged patients. While the ordinance is directed to homeless patients, it applies to transporting all patients to a location other than their own residence or other another facility. Under the ordinance:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style">A health facility may not transport or cause a patient to be transported to a location other than the patient’s residence without written consent, except when the patient is transferred to another health facility following bona fide procedures in accordance with another provision of law.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">For purposes of the ordinance:</p><ol>
										<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List ParaOverride-3">A <span class="Bold">“patient’s residence”</span> is defined as the home of the patient, the fixed and regular nighttime residence or domicile of the patient, or in the case of a patient who is reasonably perceived to be homeless, the location that the patient gives as his/her principal place of dwelling.</li>
										<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List"><span class="Bold">“Written consent”</span> is defined as knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily given written consent that is signed by the patient or his/her legal representative.</li>
									</ol><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The ordinance does not apply to patients who are in the care and custody of state hospitals or correctional facilities or law enforcement.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Although the ordinance was adopted by the City of Los Angeles and clearly applies to  hospitals located within city limits, the City Attorney has interpreted the ordinance as applying to any hospital located outside of the city limits that transports a patient to any location (and especially skid row) within the City of Los Angeles in violation of the terms of the ordinance.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The City Attorney is continuing to initiate enforcement efforts in this area and to ensure that hospitals are proactively implementing guidelines regarding evaluation and discharge planning of homeless patients.</p><hr class="HorizontalRule-1"><div class="_idFootnotes">
