			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The MSE is defined in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> as a process required to reach a decision as to whether, within reasonable clinical confidence, an individual has an EMC. The MSE must be provided in the same manner to all individuals presenting with similar signs and symptoms.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The MSE is the entry point of EMTALA-mandated services. As discussed in chapter 13, “Regulatory Enforcement of EMTALA,” a recent study found that the failure to provide an appropriate MSE was cited by CMS in 55 percent of EMTALA administrative enforcement actions between 2005 and 2014.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text"><span class="All-Caps-Bold">Note:</span> The initial section of this chapter addresses general questions and issues regarding the conduct of the MSE. There are subsequent sections on requirements for off-campus services and labor and delivery (including newborns). Medical screening of psychiatric patients is briefly discussed in this chapter, and more fully described in chapter 6, “EMTALA and Psychiatric Emergency Patients.” In addition, chapter 2, “When and Where Does EMTALA Begin and End?” includes a discussion of when, where and to whom a MSE must be provided.</p>

The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> require that patients presenting for emergency services must receive a MSE beyond initial triage:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">Triage is not equivalent to a MSE. Triage merely determines the “order” in which patients will be seen, not the presence or absence of an emergency medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip _idGenParaOverride-5"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> Hospitals should ensure that their triage classifications are based on nationally- or industry-recognized standards and that the decisions on triage classifications for emergency patients are consistent with hospital triage policies. In an EMTALA survey in California, CMS cited a hospital for inappropriate triage classification of emergency patients, finding that certain patients were classified in lower triage classifications than the reviewers believed were appropriate based on their presenting complaints, signs and symptoms.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>&#9;References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-6">42 C.F.R.

Instead, CMS has stated that an appropriate MSE will vary according to the patient’s presenting complaint, history and medical condition, as well as the capabilities of the hospital.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In general, an EMTALA enforcement survey team is instructed to identify the scope of  MSEs and patterns of care of a hospital in evaluating compliance with EMTALA. The factors described below — non-discrimination, individual and condition-specific, continuous monitoring and contemporaneous documentation — will be considered in determining whether a MSE is appropriate.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"></a>Non-<a id="_idIndexMarker003"></a>Discrimination</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> state that:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">The MSE must be the same MSE that the hospital would perform on any individual coming to the hospital’s dedicated emergency department with those signs and symptoms, regardless of the individual’s ability to pay for medical care. If a hospital applies in a nondiscriminatory manner (i.e., a different level of care must not exist based on payment status, race, national origin, etc.) a screening process that is reasonably calculated to determine whether an EMC exists, it has met its obligations under EMTALA.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The tests described in the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> are generally consistent with the standards adopted by the federal courts for providing an appropriate medical screening. In <span class="Italic">Jackson v. East Bay Hospital</span> (discussed in chapter 14, “Private Actions to Enforce EMTALA”), the court adopted the “comparative test” that has been followed by other judicial circuits:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">A medical screening must be comparable to the screening provided to patients presenting with similar signs and symptoms, unless the examination is so cursory that it is not designed to identify acute or severe symptoms alerting the physician to a possible emergency condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Although most EMTALA claims for inadequate medical screening focus on whether the examination differed from the screening performed on other patients with similar presenting complaints, signs and symptoms, an unpublished 2007 court decision<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap3_rebuild.html#footnote-001">1</a></span></span> (<span class="Italic">Lewellen v. Schneck Medical Center</span>, also discussed in chapter 14, “Private Actions to Enforce EMTALA”), found that a screening of an intoxicated, injured driver with a burst fracture failed to meet the “cursory screening” test.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> require that the screening must be provided regardless of diagnosis (e.g., labor or AIDS), financial status (e.g., insured or Medicaid), race and color, national origin, disability or other nonmedical factors. California law expressly requires that:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">In no event shall the provision of emergency services and care be based upon, or affected by, the person’s ethnicity, citizenship, age, preexisting medical condition, insurance status, economic status, ability to pay for medical services, or any other characteristic listed or defined in subdivision (b) or (e) of Section 51 of the Civil Code, except to the extent that a circumstance such as age, sex, preexisting medical condition, or physical or mental disability is medically significant to the provision of appropriate medical care to the patient.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="EMTALA_Chap3_rebuild.html#footnote-000">2</a></span></span> [Health and Safety Code Section 1317(b)]</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In performing EMTALA enforcement surveys, the surveyors are instructed to look for possible discrimination based on nonclinical factors as to the manner in which the hospital conducts MSEs. If discrimination based on nonmedical factors (i.e., patient financial status, race or other nonclinical factor) is detected, the surveyors are directed to report the information to  the Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"></a>Individual and Condition-Specific</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The scope of an appropriate MSE must be tailored to the presenting signs and symptoms and the medical history of the individual. The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> describe the screening examination as a process that may range from a simple examination (e.g., a brief focused history and examination) to a complex examination that may include laboratory tests, MRI or diagnostic imaging, lumbar punctures an<span class="No-break">d/o</span>r other diagnostic tests and procedures. In some cases, the MSE may require a reasonable period of observation and monitoring, or consultation with an on-call specialist, to determine whether the individual has an EMC.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>Continuous Monitoring</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> emphasize that a MSE is not an isolated event; it is an ongoing process. The medical record must reflect ongoing monitoring in accordance with the individual’s needs, and must continue until the individual is stabilized or appropriately transferred or discharged.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> provide that the medical record should contain evidence of an evaluation prior to discharge or departure from the hospital for a transfer to another facility.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Header-3 _idGenParaOverride-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a>Documentation</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The determination of the appropriateness of the MSE is based on the documentation of the examination. In the Investigative Procedures for EMTALA Surveyors portion of the State Operations Manual, CMS has directed surveyors to determine whether the medical record contains, as appropriate, documentation of the screening, tests, mental status, impressions and diagnosis (supported by a history and physical examination, laboratory tests and other tests and procedures).</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The importance of documentation is critical to demonstrating that the hospital provided an appropriate MSE or other required treatment. In some cases, the charting is incomplete or is missing relevant data, test results and clinical findings. In unusual cases, the medical record should explain the sequence of events, rather than random notes throughout the record or no notes at all. Many hospitals have been cited for failure to provide an adequate MSE or required treatment because of inadequate documentation. Hospitals are therefore encouraged to review a sample of emergency patient medical records, and take corrective action as may be appropriate.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>&#9;References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-6">42 C.F.R.

However, CMS also emphasized that all MSEs do not have to be “equally extensive.”</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">CMS therefore added a subsection to the EMTALA regulations to address the hospital’s obligations to a non-emergent patient who presents to a dedicated emergency department seeking examination or treatment:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">If an individual comes to a hospital’s dedicated emergency department and a request is made on his or behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition, but the nature of the request makes it clear that the medical condition is not of an emergency nature, the hospital is required only to perform such screening as would be appropriate for any individual presenting in that manner to determine that the individual does not have an emergency medical condition [42 C.F.R. Section 489.24(c)].</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">As an example, CMS described a hypothetical case of an individual who presents to a dedicated emergency department seeking the removal of sutures. The analysis by CMS of  the hypothetical case noted that the patient visit implicated the EMTALA obligations since the individual came to a dedicated emergency department seeking examination and treatment  for a medical condition.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">CMS indicated that the hospital may have an emergency nurse, who has been designated  by the hospital and medical staff as a qualified professional to perform an MSE, conduct the MSE examination by obtaining the individual’s history, examining the sutures and determining whether the wound is healing appropriately. If the nurse concludes that the patient does not have an EMC, CMS stated that the EMTALA obligations would be satisfied.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">In the preamble to the final regulations, CMS noted, however, that if it is later found that the individual who requested the removal of sutures in fact had an EMC, the extent and quality of the MSE by the nurse would be subject to review to determine whether the MSE was adequate [68 Fed. Reg. 53237].</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Hospitals that propose to use registered nurses to perform the MSE should review the discussion under <a href="EMTALA_Chap3_rebuild.html#_idTextAnchor015">H.&#160;&quot;What are the requirements for certifying nurses and other health care professionals to perform medical screening examinations?,&quot; page&#160;3.8</a>, as well as Appendix M.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span><span class="CharOverride-1">&#9;</span>Reference:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-6">42 C.F.R.

CMS has cited as EMTALA violations the use of triage slips, rather than opening a medical record, to record the results of triage or the MSE examination. Even if a patient leaves the hospital after triage and before receiving a MSE, the hospital must open a medical record for the patient and record the results of the visit.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">Records should be retained in accordance with applicable state laws and hospital policies, but in no event less than five years from the date of service.

However, if hands-on treatment is required beyond the capability of the on-site practitioner, a request for local on-call physician could be required.</p>

				<li class="Body-Styles_Header-2"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"></a>Does the medical screening examination have to be performed in a <a id="_idIndexMarker020"></a>dedicated emergency department?</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Under the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>, an individual must be “initially screened” in the dedicated emergency department before he or she can be moved to another hospital department for further screening and stabilizing treatment.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Therefore, an individual who has been triaged in the dedicated emergency department, but has not received an initial medical screening, cannot be referred to another hospital department. CMS Region IX has indicated that unless the individual presents to the dedicated emergency department seeking directions to another department (e.g., an occupational medicine clinic), the individual must receive an initial medical screening before he or she may be moved to another department for further services.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">However, Region IX has also indicated that women presenting to a dedicated emergency department with labor-related conditions may be directed or otherwise moved to the labor and delivery service without an initial screening in the emergency department, because <a id="_idIndexMarker021"></a>labor and delivery is also considered to be a dedicated emergency department for purposes of EMTALA.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">However, a hospital may not perform triage of patients in the dedicated emergency department, and then refer defined categories of patients (e.g., “nonurgent” patients) to another on-campus hospital department (that is not a dedicated emergency department) to conduct the MSE, unless an initial screening is first completed in the dedicated emergency department.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In addition, a patient who “comes to the emergency department” cannot be moved to a rural health clinic or a private physician’s office for the MSE or stabilizing treatment, even if the  rural health clinic or office is located on the hospital campus.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Following the completion of an initial screening in the dedicated emergency department, a hospital may move patients to another on-campus department if all of the following conditions are met:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">All persons with the same medical conditions are moved to the department, regardless of their ability to pay for treatment.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">There is a “bona fide medical reason” to move the patient.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">“Appropriate” medical personnel accompany the patient to the on-campus location.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The use of the term “appropriate” medical personnel (which replaced “qualified” medical personnel in a prior version of the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span>) appears to give hospitals more flexibility in assigning personnel to accompany a patient who is moved to another location for the MSE.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The same guidance about moving patients from the dedicated emergency department also applies to patients who first present to an on-campus hospital department outside of the dedicated emergency department. In that case, the individual cannot be moved to another hospital department for further examination or treatment before the individual receives an  initial screening. An internal movement of a patient within departments of the hospital that are on the hospital campus is not considered to be a “transfer” within the meaning of EMTALA.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Each hospital should adopt <a id="_idIndexMarker022"></a>policies and written directions for the movement of patients to other hospital departments that are on the hospital campus for further screening or necessary stabilizing treatment. A reasonable interpretation of the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> suggests that an attendant or a qualified professional should accompany patients who may need assistance (e.g., for medical reasons or physical or mental disability) to access the on-campus service; as appropriate, patients should be provided escort service, wheelchairs or other assistance to ensure they arrive safely at the on-campus service and that their condition will not be jeopardized by relocation to another department of the hospital.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Compliance-Tip"><span class="Compliance-Tip">Compliance Tip:</span> If a hospital decides that certain classes of patients do not need personal assistance to access another hospital department for further screening or treatment, the hospital should adopt measures to ensure that patients actually reach the on-campus service. Such measures include written instruction sheets, campus maps, notification to the on-campus service of the patient referral, and follow-up verification of the patient’s arrival. Hospitals may be at risk for an EMTALA violation if a patient decides en route to another department to leave the hospital without notifying hospital personnel. As appropriate, hospitals should consider contacting an eloped patient to determine why the patient left and his or her health status.</p>

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If a patient presents to an on-campus department of the hospital outside of the dedicated emergency department with a possible EMC, the hospital may move the patient to the dedicated emergency department (or another appropriate location on the hospital campus) after an initial screening in order to render further screening and necessary stabilizing treatment. An internal movement of a patient within departments on the hospital campus is not a “transfer” within the meaning of EMTALA.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">However, the movement of the patient from an on-campus department to the dedicated emergency department, <a id="_idIndexMarker026"></a>labor and delivery, or another hospital department must be accomplished in the same manner as moving a patient who has received an initial screening from the main emergency department to another on-campus service. Hospital policies should include the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">All patients with the same medical conditions are moved to the department or service, regardless of their ability to pay for treatment.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">There are bona fide medical reasons to move the patients.</li>
				<li class="Body-Styles_Numbered-List">Appropriate medical personnel accompany the patients to the on-campus location.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> do not address the on-campus relocation of a patient with an EMC who cannot be moved without emergency personnel and secure transport. Due to the multi-block size of many hospital campuses, including crossing public streets between “campus buildings,” it may be unsafe in certain circumstances to move an emergency patient without an ambulance and appropriate personnel and equipment.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Hospitals should develop policies and procedures for moving patients between freestanding buildings on the hospital campus to a dedicated emergency department (including, as necessary, calling <a id="_idIndexMarker027"></a>9-1-1 for patient assistance and transport), and provide in-service education to applicable personnel. The policies should address the procedures to be followed if the ambulance takes the patient to another hospital. The procedures should include contacting the receiving facility and explaining the circumstances of the ambulance transport (in order to avoid the presumption of a possible EMTALA violation) and notification of the event to hospital administration (compliance officer, risk management, etc.)</p>

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">An off-campus department or facility that is not a dedicated emergency department is not subject to EMTALA. However, emergency services provided in these departments and facilities are subject to a Medicare Condition of Participation requiring written <a id="_idIndexMarker029"></a>policies and procedures to be adopted by the hospital governing body for appraisal of emergencies and referral when appropriate.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> adopted by CMS to implement the Medicare Condition of Participation (Appendix E) for off-campus departments require the following:</p>

In addition, off-campus departments are not required to be staffed with professionals with experience handling patients presenting emergency conditions. In the preamble to the 2003 rules, CMS also stated that the policies and procedures for appraisal and referral will apply only within the hours of operation and normal staffing capability of the facility.</p>

Therefore, the labor and delivery service must comply with all of the EMTALA obligations.

As applied to a pregnant woman having contractions, the EMTALA regulations define an “emergency medical condition” as a condition in which there is inadequate time to effect a safe transfer to another hospital before delivery, or when a transfer may pose a threat to the health and safety of the woman or the unborn child. The regulations define “stabilized” as the delivery of the child and placenta.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">If a woman is in labor, the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> require that the hospital must deliver the infant or transfer the patient in an appropriate manner:</p><p class="Body-Styles_Quote-Style _idGenParaOverride-4">She may not be transferred unless she, or a legally responsible person acting on her behalf, requests a transfer and a physician or other qualified medical personnel, in consultation with a physician, certifies that the benefits to the condition of the woman and/or the unborn child outweigh the risks associated with the transfer.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">The transfer of a woman in labor is case-specific, and a high priority for EMTALA  enforcement. Therefore, CMS will review the woman’s prenatal history, her condition at the time of presentation to the hospital, the condition of the unborn child at the time of transfer or discharge, the respective capabilities of the transferring and receiving facilities, the expected delivery time and the means of transport. If the hospital discharges a woman having contractions (other than a certified false labor), CMS will closely scrutinize the condition of the woman and her unborn child, the reliability of her support systems and transportation to return to the hospital, and the actions of hospital staff.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text _idGenParaOverride-3">It is recommended that a hospital adopt policies and procedures describing the conditions and written instructions under which a woman having contractions may be sent home, or referred or transferred to another facility. The policies should also designate who may perform the screening and discharge or transfer of the patient, the need for physician consultation  and requirements for countersigning (if applicable) determinations of false labor. Additionally, hospitals should implement quality improvement and risk management reviews of discharges and transfers of women having contractions.</p><p class="Body-Styles_Reference-Header _idGenParaOverride-3"><span class="Reference-mark">F</span>&#9;References:</p><p class="Body-Styles_References _idGenParaOverride-6">42 C.F.R.

Prior to Oct. 1, 2006, the EMTALA regulations required a physician to be consulted before discharge and to countersign the certification of false labor.

			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">In April 2005, CMS issued a memorandum providing guidance that the EMTALA obligations for providing a MSE and stabilizing treatment may apply to infants who are “born alive.” The substance of the memorandum, entitled “Interaction of the Emergency Medical Treatment  and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) and the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002,” has been incorporated in tag no. A-240<span class="No-break">6/C</span>-2406 of the <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guidelines</span> (Appendix C).</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">Under the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, infants are considered to be “born alive” if they are delivered by any means at any stage of development, and following complete expulsion or extraction, breathe, or have a beating heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord or definite movement of voluntary muscles regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut and regardless of whether the expulsion or extraction occurs as a result of natural or induced labor, C-section or induced labor.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">According to the CMS memorandum, the EMTALA obligations, including medical screening and stabilizing treatment, apply to an infant who is “born alive” in a dedicated emergency department (which includes labor and delivery) if there is a request on the infant’s behalf for, or a prudent layperson would conclude that the infant needs, examination or treatment for a potential EMC.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">If the infant is “born alive” at a location on hospital property that is not a dedicated emergency department, an MSE is required if there is a request on the infant’s behalf for, or a prudent layperson would conclude that the infant needs, examination or treatment for a potential EMC.</p>
			<p class="Body-Styles_Body-Text">The CMS guidance on the application of EMTALA to the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act reaffirms that EMTALA does not apply to inpatients. Therefore, CMS has indicated that  an infant who is considered to be an inpatient is covered by the Medicare Conditions of Participation rather than EMTALA.</p>
